# CorticAI

**Living memory for intelligent development**

CorticAI will be a context engine that gives your projects persistent, intelligent memory. Like a digital cortex, it will maintain context across sessions, prevent knowledge loss, and enable AI agents and developers to understand code and documents from multiple perspectives. Built with TypeScript and the Mastra.ai framework, CorticAI will transform isolated files into a living knowledge graph that learns and evolves with your project.

## The Problem

Every project suffers from context fragmentation:
- AI agents recreate the same files repeatedly, having no memory of previous work
- Deleted branches take valuable learning with them  
- Knowledge exists in silos across code, docs, issues, and human memory
- File systems force single-hierarchy organization when you need multiple views
- Context degrades over time as documentation goes stale and patterns are forgotten

## The Solution

CorticAI will act as a persistent cortex layer for your projects, providing:

**Intelligent Memory** - Will maintain context across all sessions, preventing amnesia loops where agents recreate existing work

**Multi-Perspective Access** - Will enable viewing the same code through different lenses (debugging, architecture, performance) with relevant context emphasized

**Organic Evolution** - Will learn patterns from usage, consolidate knowledge during quiet periods, and grow more intelligent over time

**Universal Connections** - Will create rich relationships between all project elements, from code functions to design decisions to issue discussions

**Historical Preservation** - Will maintain a complete episodic archive, including deleted branches and failed experiments, so learning is never lost

**Intelligent Deduplication** - Will actively prevent duplicate file creation and maintain information freshness through automatic consolidation

## How It Will Work

CorticAI will implement a dual-layer architecture inspired by human memory:

1. **Working Memory** - Captures immediate changes and active patterns
2. **Semantic Memory** - Stores consolidated, long-term knowledge  
3. **Episodic Archive** - Preserves complete history for conflict resolution

During active development, CorticAI will observe and index all changes. During quiet periods, it will consolidate knowledge, detect patterns, and update its understanding - similar to how human memory consolidates during sleep.

## Planned Features

- **Domain Agnostic** - Will work equally well with code, documentation, contracts, creative writing, or any text-based content
- **Progressive Context Loading** - Will load information at the appropriate level of detail (signature → structure → semantic → detailed → historical)
- **Lens System** - Task-specific views that will emphasize relevant information and hide distractions
- **External Integration** - Will connect with GitHub Issues, Jira, and other tools to augment context
- **Decision Governance** - Optional integration with decision approval systems to prevent unilateral architectural choices
- **Pattern Learning** - Will discover patterns across domains and projects, building reusable knowledge

## Technology Stack

- **TypeScript** - Full type safety and modern JavaScript features
- **Mastra.ai** - Powerful AI agent framework for intelligent operations
- **Kuzu** - Embedded graph database for relationship management
- **DuckDB** - High-performance analytics for materialized views and search

## Use Cases

- **AI-Assisted Development** - Give AI agents memory across sessions
- **Large Codebases** - Navigate complex projects through conceptual relationships
- **Team Knowledge Management** - Preserve institutional knowledge as team members change
- **Multi-Domain Projects** - Connect code, documentation, contracts, and communications
- **Learning & Analysis** - Discover patterns and insights across project history

## Philosophy

CorticAI is built on the principle that **context is not metadata - it's memory**. Just as the human cortex maintains rich, interconnected memories that inform understanding, CorticAI will create a living knowledge graph that makes your project's implicit knowledge explicit and accessible.

## Status

CorticAI is in the design phase. Development will begin with the core storage and indexing engine, followed by the intelligence layer and external integrations. We welcome feedback on the architecture and approach as we build toward an initial release.
