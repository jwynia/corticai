# CorticAI Self-Hosting Validation

## Overview

This document describes how CorticAI validates its own meta-capabilities by managing its own development context. Self-hosting proves that CorticAI can prevent the exact coordination problems it was designed to solve.

## What is Self-Hosting?

Self-hosting means using CorticAI to analyze and manage the CorticAI project's own context network - the planning documents, task tracking, and code that make up the project itself. This provides:

1. **Meta-Validation**: Proves the system works for complex, real-world contexts
2. **Dogfooding**: The team uses the tool they're building
3. **Problem Detection**: Catches coordination issues before they cause problems
4. **Value Demonstration**: Shows concrete examples of coordination improvement

## The Bootstrap Problem

CorticAI was created to solve context navigation problems, but during its own development, we encountered the exact problem it was designed to solve:

**Example**: A planning document for CosmosDB implementation was created without proper navigation links. Fresh agents (or team members) starting from `planning/index.md` couldn't discover this work, leading to potential duplicate effort.

**Solution**: Use CorticAI to detect and prevent these orphaned planning nodes.

## Running Self-Hosting Validation

### Quick Start

```typescript
import { runSelfHostingValidation } from './src/examples/SelfHostingExample'

// Run complete validation
const report = await runSelfHostingValidation()
console.log(report)
```

### Manual Configuration

```typescript
import { SelfHostingManager } from './src/examples/SelfHostingExample'

const manager = new SelfHostingManager({
  contextNetworkPath: '/path/to/context-network',
  projectRoot: '/path/to/project',
  includePlanning: true,
  includeTasks: true,
  includeCode: false  // Focus on planning coordination
})

// Initialize CorticAI
await manager.initialize()

// Analyze planning documents
const planningEntities = await manager.analyzePlanningDocuments()
console.log(`Extracted ${planningEntities.length} entities from planning docs`)

// Generate full report
const report = await manager.generateReport()
```

## What Gets Validated

### 1. Context Network Indexing

- ✅ CorticAI can initialize its `.context` directory structure
- ✅ Discovers planning documents in `context-network/planning/`
- ✅ Discovers task documents in `context-network/tasks/`
- ✅ Processes markdown files with proper entity extraction

### 2. Entity Extraction from Planning Documents

- ✅ Extracts document, section, and reference entities
- ✅ Captures task information (status, complexity, priorities)
- ✅ Identifies cross-references between planning documents
- ✅ Maintains proper metadata (line numbers, levels, paths)

### 3. Cross-Domain Relationship Detection

- ✅ Correlates planning tasks with code implementation
- ✅ Detects when planning references specific code files
- ✅ Identifies orphaned planning nodes (no navigation links)
- ✅ Validates hierarchy signals (parent/child relationships)

### 4. Coordination Problem Prevention

- ✅ Detects planning documents with no navigation links
- ✅ Identifies documents properly connected to planning hierarchy
- ✅ Validates documents have parent context signals
- ✅ Warns about potential coordination failures

### 5. Performance Measurement

- ✅ Context discovery completes in < 100ms per document
- ✅ Handles 10+ documents in < 200ms total
- ✅ Efficient enough for real-time use during development

## Example Self-Hosting Report

```
# CorticAI Self-Hosting Validation Report

## Summary
- **Planning Documents Analyzed**: 5
- **Task Documents Analyzed**: 12
- **Total Entities Extracted**: 342
- **Sections**: 87
- **References**: 23
- **Orphaned Nodes Detected**: 0

## Orphaned Planning Nodes

✅ No orphaned nodes detected - excellent navigation structure!

## Entity Type Distribution

- **document**: 17
- **section**: 87
- **paragraph**: 215
- **reference**: 23

## Coordination Problem Prevention

✅ CorticAI successfully prevents the orphaned planning problem
   it was designed to solve.

## Recommendations

✅ Current planning structure is well-connected:
- All documents have proper navigation links
- Hierarchy is properly signaled
- Fresh agents can discover context through navigation
```

## Use Cases

### 1. Pre-Commit Validation

Run self-hosting before committing planning changes:

```bash
npm run self-host:validate
```

This catches orphaned planning nodes before they enter the codebase.

### 2. CI/CD Integration

Add to your CI pipeline:

```yaml
- name: Validate Planning Structure
  run: npm run self-host:validate
```

Fails the build if coordination problems are detected.

### 3. Developer Onboarding

New team members can run self-hosting to:
- Understand project structure
- See how CorticAI works in practice
- Learn planning conventions

### 4. Planning Reviews

Use the report during planning reviews:
- Identify missing navigation links
- Validate hierarchy is discoverable
- Check cross-references are complete

## Test Coverage

Self-hosting validation has comprehensive test coverage:

- **13 test cases** covering all aspects
- **100% passing** - all tests green
- **Test-first development** - tests written before implementation
- **Real-world validation** - tests use actual context network

See `tests/context/SelfHosting.test.ts` for details.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **ContextInitializer**: Creates `.context` structure for any project
2. **UniversalFallbackAdapter**: Extracts entities from markdown planning docs
3. **SelfHostingManager**: Orchestrates analysis and reporting
4. **Test Suite**: Validates all capabilities work correctly

### Data Flow

```
Context Network (planning/*.md, tasks/*.md)
            ↓
    UniversalFallbackAdapter
            ↓
    Entity Extraction (sections, references, etc.)
            ↓
    Orphaned Node Detection
            ↓
    Report Generation
```

## Coordination Problems Prevented

### Problem 1: Orphaned Planning Nodes

**Scenario**: Planning document created without navigation links
**Detection**: No references found to/from other planning docs
**Prevention**: Self-hosting flags orphaned nodes in report
**Fix**: Add proper navigation links before committing

### Problem 2: Hidden Implementation Details

**Scenario**: Detailed planning buried in task without parent links
**Detection**: Task document has no parent planning context
**Prevention**: Self-hosting validates hierarchy signals
**Fix**: Add parent references to make discoverable

### Problem 3: Duplicate Planning

**Scenario**: Fresh agent creates new planning without finding existing
**Detection**: Multiple documents covering same topic, no cross-links
**Prevention**: Self-hosting shows all planning docs and relationships
**Fix**: Merge or properly link related planning

## Best Practices

### Planning Document Structure

Always include navigation:

```markdown
# Planning Document Title

**Parent**: [planning/index](./index.md)
**Related**: [roadmap](./roadmap.md), [tasks/current-sprint](../tasks/sprint-next.md)

## Content...
```

### Task Document Structure

Always link to parent planning:

```markdown
# Task: Implement Feature X

**Parent Planning**: [groomed-backlog](../planning/groomed-backlog.md)
**Related Tasks**: [task-123](./task-123.md)

## Implementation...
```

### Hierarchy Signals

Make parent-child relationships explicit:

```markdown
**Children**: See [task-001](../tasks/task-001.md) for implementation details
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for self-hosting:

1. **Wiki-Link Support**: Extract `[[reference]]` style links (currently uses `[text](url)`)
2. **Automatic Navigation Fix**: Suggest navigation links for orphaned nodes
3. **Relationship Visualization**: Generate graph of planning document relationships
4. **Coverage Analysis**: Track which planning areas have good vs poor connectivity
5. **Historical Trends**: Monitor coordination problems over time

## Conclusion

Self-hosting validation proves that:

✅ CorticAI can manage complex, real-world development contexts
✅ Entity extraction works for planning and task documents
✅ Coordination problems can be detected and prevented
✅ The system prevents the problems it was designed to solve
✅ Performance is suitable for real-time developer use

This meta-capability validates CorticAI's core value proposition: preventing coordination failures in complex projects.
