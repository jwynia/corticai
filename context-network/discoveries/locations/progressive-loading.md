# Progressive Loading System Implementation Discovery

## Context Depth Enumeration and Memory-Efficient Loading
**Found**: `app/src/types/context.ts:20-35`
**Summary**: Implements a 5-level progressive loading system with ContextDepth enum (SIGNATURE, STRUCTURE, SEMANTIC, DETAILED, HISTORICAL) for memory-efficient context retrieval.
**Significance**: This is the core mechanism that enables 80% memory reduction by loading only necessary detail levels, preventing memory bloat while maintaining system responsiveness for large knowledge graphs.

## Depth-Aware Entity Structure
**Found**: `app/src/types/context.ts:37-85`
**Summary**: Defines DepthAwareEntity interface that organizes entity properties into depth-based layers, enabling selective property loading.
**Significance**: Provides the data structure foundation for progressive loading, ensuring entities can be partially loaded and incrementally enhanced as deeper context is needed.

## Projection and Validation Functions
**Found**: `app/src/types/context.ts:120-180`
**Summary**: Implements createDepthProjection, validateDepth, and getDepthMetadata utility functions for managing depth-based operations.
**Significance**: These utilities ensure type safety and provide the operational foundation for depth-aware query execution and entity projection.

## Integration with Query System
**Found**: `app/src/query/QueryBuilder.ts:37-41`
**Summary**: ContextDepth is imported and integrated into the QueryBuilder system, enabling depth-aware query construction.
**Significance**: Demonstrates that progressive loading is not just a data structure concept but is deeply integrated into the query execution pipeline.

## Performance Impact
**Found**: Context network reports 80% memory reduction
**Summary**: Progressive loading system achieves substantial memory optimization while maintaining query performance.
**Significance**: Validates that the depth-based approach delivers on its core promise of scaling to large knowledge graphs without proportional memory growth.
