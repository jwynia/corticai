# Novel Adapter Implementation Discovery

## Domain-Specific Adapter Architecture
**Found**: `app/src/adapters/NovelAdapter.ts:21-40`
**Summary**: Implements NovelAdapter that extends UniversalFallbackAdapter to provide specialized narrative content analysis including character detection, scene identification, and dialogue classification.
**Significance**: Proves the domain adapter pattern works effectively, demonstrating how the universal foundation can be extended for specific content domains while maintaining compatibility with the core system.
