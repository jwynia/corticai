# Lens System Implementation Discovery

## Core Lens Interface and Base Classes
**Found**: `app/src/context/lenses/ContextLens.ts:1-80`
**Summary**: Implements BaseLens abstract class and LensError for the core lens system, providing common functionality for query transformation and result processing.
**Significance**: This establishes the foundational architecture for the lens system, enabling context-aware query modification and result filtering through a composable lens framework.

## Lens Registry and Management
**Found**: `app/src/context/lenses/LensRegistry.ts`
**Summary**: Provides lens registration, discovery, conflict resolution, and priority ordering for the lens management system.
**Significance**: Enables dynamic lens composition and management, allowing multiple lenses to be applied in proper sequence with conflict resolution, critical for context-aware query execution.

## Configuration and Validation
**Found**: `app/src/context/lenses/ContextLens.ts:22, 68-77`
**Summary**: Implements validateLensConfig and LensConfigValidationError for ensuring lens configurations are valid and consistent.
**Significance**: Provides type safety and runtime validation for lens configurations, preventing invalid lens setups that could compromise query results or system stability.

## Query Context Integration
**Found**: `app/src/context/lenses/ContextLens.ts:14-21`
**Summary**: Imports and integrates with Query types, ContextDepth, and activation context to enable depth-aware lens operations.
**Significance**: Demonstrates deep integration between the lens system and progressive loading, enabling lenses to operate at specific depth levels and modify queries contextually.

## Lens Types and Interfaces
**Found**: `app/src/context/lenses/types.ts` (referenced in imports)
**Summary**: Defines ContextLens, LensConfig, ActivationContext, and QueryContext interfaces for the lens system type architecture.
**Significance**: Provides the complete type system for lens operations, ensuring type safety across lens composition, activation, and query transformation processes.
