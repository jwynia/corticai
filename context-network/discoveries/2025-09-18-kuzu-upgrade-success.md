# Discovery: Kuzu 0.11.2 Upgrade Success

## Classification
- **Domain**: Technical/Storage
- **Stability**: Established
- **Abstraction**: Implementation
- **Confidence**: Verified

## Discovery Context
- **Date**: 2025-09-18
- **Task**: Upgrade Kuzu from 0.6.1 to 0.11.2
- **Impact**: High - Removes need for workarounds

## Upgrade Results

### Version Change
- **Previous**: Kuzu 0.6.1 (with significant limitations)
- **Current**: Kuzu 0.11.2 (latest stable)

### Features Now Available
1. **Variable-Length Paths**: `[*1..n]` syntax now works
   - Tested: `MATCH path = (source)-[r:Relationship*1..3]-(target)`
   - Result: ✅ Successfully returns multiple paths

2. **SHORTEST Path Algorithm**: Native support
   - Tested: `MATCH path = (source)-[r* SHORTEST 1..5]-(target)`
   - Result: ✅ Returns optimal path

3. **Better Cypher Compatibility**: More standard Neo4j syntax works

### Migration Notes
- Database path must be a file, not directory (e.g., `/path/to/db/kuzu.db`)
- Some cleanup issues noted (segfault on close) but doesn't affect functionality
- Existing workarounds can be removed

## Updated Query Examples

### Before (0.6.1 Workarounds)
```cypher
-- Single-hop fallback
MATCH (source:Entity {id: $nodeId})-[r:Relationship]->(target:Entity)
```

### After (0.11.2 Proper Syntax)
```cypher
-- Variable-length paths work
MATCH path = (source:Entity {id: $nodeId})-[r:Relationship*1..5]-(target:Entity)
RETURN path
```

## Impact on Codebase
- KuzuSecureQueryBuilder updated to use proper syntax
- Fallback strategies no longer needed
- Tests need updating to expect new query formats
- Performance should improve with native path algorithms

## Follow-up Actions
1. Update test expectations for new query syntax
2. Remove comments about version limitations
3. Document new capabilities
4. Consider using more advanced Kuzu features
