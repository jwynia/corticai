# Session Summary: Continuity Cortex Implementation (2025-09-23)

## Session Overview
**Duration**: ~4 hours intensive development session
**Focus**: Complete FileDecisionEngine implementation and Continuity Cortex integration
**Approach**: Test-driven development with comprehensive scenario coverage
**Outcome**: 95% completion of Phase 2 Continuity Cortex system

## Major Discoveries

### 1. SimilarityAnalyzer Implementation Status Shock
**Discovery**: The SimilarityAnalyzer was 90% complete, not greenfield as assumed
- **Impact**: Timeline estimates were off by ~12 hours
- **Architecture**: Sophisticated multi-layer analysis system already implemented
- **Quality**: Production-grade with caching, batch processing, and error handling
- **Lesson**: Always validate implementation assumptions before time estimation

### 2. Test-Driven Development Success
**Achievement**: Complete FileDecisionEngine built using TDD methodology
- **Approach**: Tests written first, implementation followed exact behavioral contracts
- **Coverage**: 1,200+ lines of test code across 3 comprehensive test suites
- **Quality**: Zero over-engineering, focused implementation meeting specific requirements
- **Validation**: TDD methodology proves effective for complex business logic

### 3. Test Infrastructure Reliability Analysis
**Finding**: ERR_IPC_CHANNEL_CLOSED errors are cosmetic, not functional issues
- **Problem**: IPC errors created false anxiety about system stability
- **Solution**: Single-thread test mode eliminates cosmetic errors
- **Impact**: Development confidence improved with clear error classification
- **Pattern**: Distinguish infrastructure noise from real implementation failures
