# Discovery Record: Kuzu Graph Operations Implementation

## Date: 2025-09-16
## Component: KuzuStorageAdapter

## What I Was Looking For
How to implement real Kuzu graph queries to replace mock implementations in traverse(), findConnected(), and shortestPath() methods.

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Kuzu Query Syntax
**Found**: `/app/src/storage/adapters/KuzuStorageAdapter.ts:567-747`
**Summary**: Kuzu uses Cypher-like syntax with specific patterns:
- Variable length paths: `-[r*1..depth]-`
- Shortest path: `-[r* SHORTEST 1..10]-`
- Bidirectional: `-[*1..depth]-` (no arrow)
**Significance**: Enables complex graph traversal with familiar Cypher patterns

### 2. Kuzu Result Format
**Found**: `/app/src/storage/adapters/KuzuStorageAdapter.ts:776-844`
**Summary**: Kuzu returns paths as RECURSIVE_REL type with `_nodes` and `_rels` arrays
**Significance**: Required custom conversion logic to transform to GraphPath interface

### 3. Query Execution Pattern
**Found**: `/app/src/storage/adapters/KuzuStorageAdapter.ts:611,669,726`
**Summary**: Pattern is `connection.query(cypher)` then `result.getAll()` for results
**Significance**: Simple async/await pattern for all queries

### 4. String Escaping Requirement
**Found**: `/app/src/storage/adapters/KuzuStorageAdapter.ts:761-774`
**Summary**: Kuzu v0.6.1 doesn't support parameterized queries, requiring manual escaping
**Significance**: Security vulnerability that needs future mitigation

## Implementation Insights

### Mock to Real Transformation
The mock implementations returned hardcoded data to prevent test hangs while the Kuzu API was being understood. Key transformation:
- Mock: Returned static GraphPath objects
- Real: Builds Cypher queries dynamically based on input patterns

### Error Handling Pattern
Currently swallows errors and returns empty results - identified as tech debt needing consistent error strategy.

### Performance Constraints
Added limits to prevent runaway queries:
- DEFAULT_PATH_LIMIT = 100
- DEFAULT_CONNECTED_LIMIT = 1000
- DEFAULT_MAX_TRAVERSAL_DEPTH = 10

## Follow-up Items
- Implement parameterized queries when Kuzu supports them
- Define consistent error handling strategy
- Add performance monitoring for graph operations
