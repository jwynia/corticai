- Mode: Full sync with task source updates
- Confidence threshold: All levels

---

## Completed Work Discovered

### High Confidence Completions

1. **Mastra Framework Integration**
   - Evidence: Complete implementation in `/app/src/mastra/`
   - Implementation location: weather agent, workflow, and tool
   - Deviations: Used weather domain as proof of concept instead of context processing
   - Action: Mark as complete in unified backlog

2. **OpenRouter Integration**
   - Evidence: Working configuration with official @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider
   - Implementation location: `/app/src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts`
   - Documentation: Discovery pattern documented
   - Action: Mark as complete and archive

3. **Research: Universal Patterns**
   - Evidence: Comprehensive research documents created
   - Implementation location: `/context-network/research/universal_patterns/`
   - Coverage: Cross-domain patterns, adapter framework, domain discovery
   - Action: Mark research phase complete

4. **Research: Dependency Relationships**
   - Evidence: Full documentation of dependency patterns
   - Implementation location: `/context-network/research/relationships/`
   - Coverage: Dependency patterns, shared attribute systems
   - Action: Mark research phase complete

5. **Research: Memory Consolidation**
   - Evidence: Cognitive model research completed
   - Implementation location: `/context-network/research/cognitive_models/`
   - Coverage: Memory consolidation, attention mechanisms, learning patterns
   - Action: Mark research phase complete

6. **Context Network Structure**
   - Evidence: Full hierarchical structure implemented
   - Implementation location: `/context-network/` with all subdirectories
   - Coverage: Templates, navigation, maintenance guides
   - Action: Mark as operational

## Network Updates Required

### Immediate Updates (Applied)
- [x] Created sync-state.json with 6 completed task records
- [x] Generated sync report for audit trail
- [ ] Update unified_backlog.md to mark research items complete
- [ ] Move completed research tasks to archive section

### Manual Review Needed
- [ ] Verify weather demo aligns with project goals
- [ ] Determine if Mastra integration needs expansion
- [ ] Review if research phase should transition to implementation

---

## Drift Patterns Detected

### Systematic Issues
1. **Implementation vs Planning Gap**
   - Planned: Context engine components
   - Actual: Weather demonstration app
   - Recommendation: Align demo with core project goals

2. **Research Completion Not Tracked**
   - All research tasks completed but still marked as pending
   - Documentation lag: ~1 day
   - Recommendation: Update task tracking immediately after research completion

3. **No Implementation Started on Core Components**
   - Universal Fallback Adapter: Not started
   - TypeScript Dependency Analyzer: Not started
   - Attribute Index: Not started
   - Risk: Project may be stuck in research phase

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Transition to Implementation Phase**
   - Research foundation is solid
   - Time to validate through building
   - Start with Universal Fallback Adapter

2. **Update Task Tracking**
   - Mark all completed research as done
   - Create new implementation-focused sprint
   - Set concrete deadlines for proof of concepts

3. **Align Demo with Goals**
   - Consider refactoring weather demo to context demo
   - Or create parallel context implementation
   - Document decision in ADR

### Process Improvements
1. **Daily Sync Runs**
   - Run `/sync` at end of each work session
   - Prevents documentation drift
   - Maintains accurate project state

2. **Task Completion Protocol**
   - Mark tasks complete immediately
   - Don't batch documentation updates
   - Include evidence in completion notes

---

## Applied Changes

### Task Source Updates
- Created `/context-network/meta/sync-state.json` with 6 completions
- Ready to update `/context-network/planning/unified_backlog.md` pending approval

### Sync State Management
- Initialized sync state tracking system
- Documented 6 completed tasks with high confidence
- Prepared grooming hints for next planning session

---

## Validation Results

### Research Phase Status
✅ Universal patterns: COMPLETE (3 comprehensive documents)
✅ Dependency relationships: COMPLETE (2 detailed analyses)
✅ Memory consolidation: COMPLETE (3 cognitive models)
✅ Context network structure: COMPLETE (full hierarchy implemented)

### Implementation Phase Status
❌ Universal Fallback Adapter: NOT STARTED
❌ TypeScript Dependency Analyzer: NOT STARTED  
❌ Attribute Index: NOT STARTED

### Infrastructure Status
✅ Mastra integration: OPERATIONAL
✅ OpenRouter configuration: WORKING
✅ Context network: ESTABLISHED
✅ Development environment: READY

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve this sync report**
2. **Run `/groom` to update task backlogs based on sync findings**
3. **Begin Sprint 1 focused on implementation**:
   - Universal Fallback Adapter (2 days)
   - Basic Attribute Index (1 day)
   - TypeScript Dependency Analyzer (2 days)
