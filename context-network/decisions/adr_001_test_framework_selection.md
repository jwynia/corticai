# ADR-001: Test Framework Selection - Vitest

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The project needed a test framework for implementing the Universal Fallback Adapter using Test-Driven Development (TDD). The main options were Jest and Vitest.

## Decision
We selected **Vitest** as the test framework for this project.

## Rationale

### Vitest Advantages
- **Speed**: Significantly faster than Jest, especially for TypeScript projects
- **TypeScript-first**: Better native TypeScript support without additional configuration
- **Modern**: Built on Vite, aligns with modern tooling
- **API Compatible**: Uses Jest-compatible API, making migration easy
- **HMR Support**: Hot module replacement for tests during development

### Jest Advantages (Not Selected)
- More mature ecosystem
- Broader community support
- Used by Mastra framework

### Decision Factors
1. **Performance**: Vitest's speed advantage is significant for TDD workflow
2. **TypeScript**: Native TS support reduces configuration complexity
3. **Future-proof**: Aligns with modern JavaScript tooling trends

## Consequences

### Positive
- Faster test execution improves TDD cycle time
- Simpler TypeScript configuration
- Better developer experience with HMR

### Negative
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Jest
- Potential compatibility issues with some Jest plugins
- Team may need to learn new tool (minimal due to API compatibility)

## Implementation
```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest @vitest/ui happy-dom @testing-library/jest-dom
```
