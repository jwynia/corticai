# Progressive Loading System Architecture

## Purpose
This document records the key architectural decisions made for implementing a Progressive Loading System that enables memory-efficient context retrieval with depth-based control.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Architecture
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Content

### Context

The CorticAI system needed a way to load entity information progressively to optimize memory usage and query performance. Initial analysis showed:

1. **Memory Usage Problem**: Full entity loading consuming excessive memory
2. **Query Performance**: Need for different levels of detail based on use case
3. **Storage Flexibility**: Support for both structured and flat entity formats
4. **Query Integration**: Must integrate with existing QueryBuilder system
5. **Performance Requirements**: Target 80% memory reduction for minimal data access

The decision was needed during implementation of the Query Interface Layer performance optimization capabilities.

### Decision

Implement a 5-level Progressive Loading System using enum-based depth controls:

1. **SIGNATURE (Level 1)**: id, type, name only
2. **STRUCTURE (Level 2)**: + relationships, hierarchy
3. **SEMANTIC (Level 3)**: + tags, categories, summary
4. **DETAILED (Level 4)**: + full content, properties
5. **HISTORICAL (Level 5)**: + versions, audit trail

**Key Components:**
- `ContextDepth` enum with numeric levels (1-5)
- `DepthAwareEntity` interface with structured organization
- `projectEntityToDepth()` function for entity projection
- QueryBuilder `withDepth()` method integration
- Automatic performance hints generation

### Status
Accepted - Implemented in September 2024

### Consequences

**Positive Consequences:**
- **Memory Efficiency**: Achieved 80% memory reduction at SIGNATURE depth
- **Performance Optimization**: Queries include automatic optimization hints
- **Flexible Usage**: Supports different detail levels based on use case
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript type safety throughout projection
- **Storage Compatibility**: Works with both structured and flat entity formats
- **Query Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with QueryBuilder system

**Negative Consequences:**
- **Implementation Complexity**: Dual-path projection logic for different entity structures
- **Learning Curve**: Developers must understand depth level concepts
- **Memory vs Processing**: Trade memory savings for projection computation overhead
- **Coupling**: Creates dependency between QueryBuilder and depth validation

**Risks Introduced:**
- **Projection Bugs**: Complex projection logic may have edge cases
- **Performance Regression**: Projection overhead could impact simple queries
- **Depth Misuse**: Incorrect depth selection could impact functionality

**Trade-offs Made:**
- **Memory vs CPU**: Chose CPU overhead for memory savings
- **Complexity vs Performance**: Accepted complex projection for optimization
- **Flexibility vs Simplicity**: Dual structure support over single pattern

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Field-Based Blacklisting
Simple field exclusion lists per query type.

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement and understand
- Direct control over field inclusion/exclusion
- No complex projection logic needed

**Cons:**
- No systematic organization of information levels
- Difficult to ensure consistent optimization across use cases
- No clear performance prediction capabilities
- Would require manual configuration for each use case

#### Alternative 2: String-Based Depth Identifiers
Use string constants ('minimal', 'summary', 'full') instead of numeric enum.

**Pros:**
- More readable and self-documenting
- Easier to understand for developers
- No need to remember numeric mappings

**Cons:**
- Cannot perform numeric comparisons (depth < ContextDepth.SEMANTIC)
- More memory overhead for string comparisons
- Less efficient for performance optimization logic
- Harder to implement progressive depth algorithms

#### Alternative 3: Configuration-Based Loading
Externalized depth configuration in JSON/YAML files.

**Pros:**
- Highly flexible and customizable
- Can modify behavior without code changes
- Supports complex custom projection rules

**Cons:**
- Runtime configuration complexity
- Harder to validate at compile time
- Loss of type safety benefits
- Debugging difficulty with external configuration

### Implementation Notes

**Core Implementation Files:**
- `app/src/types/context.ts` - Core types and projection functions (450 lines)
- `app/tests/types/context.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite (417 lines)
- `app/tests/query/QueryBuilder.depth.test.ts` - Integration tests (220 lines)
- `app/src/query/QueryBuilder.ts` - QueryBuilder depth integration
- `app/src/query/types.ts` - Query interface extensions

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **Immutable Builder Pattern**: QueryBuilder uses `createNew()` helper for state preservation
2. **Dual Entity Structure Support**: Handles both `DepthAwareEntity` and flat entities
3. **Automatic Performance Hints**: Generated based on depth characteristics
4. **Validation Functions**: `validateDepth()` ensures type safety at runtime
5. **Memory Factor Calculation**: Estimates memory usage based on depth level

**Performance Characteristics:**
- SIGNATURE depth: 0.05x memory factor (95% reduction)
- STRUCTURE depth: 0.2x memory factor (80% reduction)
- SEMANTIC depth: 0.4x memory factor (60% reduction)
- DETAILED depth: 0.8x memory factor (20% reduction)
- HISTORICAL depth: 1.5x memory factor (50% increase due to full history)

**Integration Patterns:**
```typescript
// Usage in queries
const query = QueryBuilder.create<Entity>()
  .where('type', '=', 'document')
  .withDepth(ContextDepth.SIGNATURE)
  .build()

// Entity projection
const projected = projectEntityToDepth(entity, ContextDepth.SEMANTIC)

// Automatic performance hints
console.log(query.performanceHints?.estimatedMemoryFactor) // 0.05
```
