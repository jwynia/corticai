# Research Revival Plan - External Sources Integration

## Purpose
The original research phase produced entirely self-generated conceptual frameworks without external validation. This plan outlines a systematic re-examination of all "completed" research using external research tools and academic sources.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Research
- **Stability:** Active
- **Abstraction:** Strategic
- **Confidence:** High

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- All research marked as "complete" contains **zero external citations**
- No validation against existing academic work or industry solutions
- No building on established research or patterns
- Potential reinvention of existing solutions
- Project stuck in research phase without external validation

### Available Tools Not Used
- `mcp__research__deepResearchReport` - Comprehensive research via Perplexity
- `mcp__research__mediumResearchReport` - Detailed research reports
- `mcp__research__basicWebSearch` - Web search capability
- `mcp__context7__get-library-docs` - Library documentation
- `mcp__deepwiki__ask_question` - Repository documentation queries
- `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` - General web research

## Research Tasks to Re-examine

### 1. Universal Patterns Across Domains
**Original**: Self-generated patterns for code, documents, novels, contracts
**Needed Research**:
- Cross-domain knowledge representation systems
- Ontology design patterns
- Existing universal schema approaches
- Graph-based knowledge representation
- Academic work on domain adaptation

**Key Questions**:
- What existing systems handle multiple domains?
- How do knowledge graphs represent cross-domain relationships?
- What are established patterns for domain-agnostic entity extraction?

### 2. Dependency Relationship Patterns
**Original**: Custom dependency types and detection strategies
**Needed Research**:
- Software dependency analysis tools and algorithms
- Graph theory approaches to dependency management
- Existing AST-based analysis frameworks
- Academic papers on program dependence graphs
- Industry tools like LSP, tree-sitter, CodeQL

**Key Questions**:
- How do existing code intelligence tools track dependencies?
- What graph algorithms are used for dependency analysis?
- How do build systems and package managers model dependencies?

### 3. Memory Consolidation & Cognitive Models
**Original**: Three-tier memory architecture inspired by human cognition
**Needed Research**:
- Cognitive science literature on memory consolidation
- Working memory models in psychology
- Computer science applications of cognitive architectures
- Existing tiered storage systems
- Cache algorithms and memory hierarchies

**Key Questions**:
- What does neuroscience say about memory consolidation?
- How have cognitive models been applied to information systems?
- What are proven patterns for tiered knowledge storage?

### 4. Graph Database for Context Systems
**Original**: Decision to use Kuzu without comparative analysis
**Needed Research**:
- Graph database comparison (Neo4j, DGraph, Kuzu, others)
- Graph database patterns for knowledge management
- Performance benchmarks for different use cases
- Academic papers on graph-based context modeling

**Key Questions**:
- What graph databases are used for similar systems?
- What are the trade-offs between different graph storage approaches?
- How do existing code intelligence tools store relationships?

### 5. Code Intelligence & AST Analysis
**Original**: Basic AST parsing concepts
**Needed Research**:
- Language Server Protocol (LSP) capabilities
- Tree-sitter and other parsing frameworks
- Semantic code search approaches
- CodeQL and similar query languages
- Academic work on program analysis

**Key Questions**:
- How do modern IDEs build code intelligence?
- What are state-of-the-art approaches to semantic code search?
- How do tools like GitHub Copilot understand code context?

### 6. Context Fragmentation Solutions
**Original**: Problem analysis without existing solution research
**Needed Research**:
- Existing solutions for context aggregation
- Information integration patterns
- Knowledge graph federation
- Distributed context management
- Academic work on information fragmentation

**Key Questions**:
- How do existing tools solve context fragmentation?
- What are proven patterns for information integration?
- How do knowledge management systems handle distributed sources?

## Research Methodology

### Phase 1: Literature Review (Per Topic)
1. Use `mcp__research__deepResearchReport` for comprehensive overview
2. Search for academic papers and citations
3. Identify key researchers and institutions
4. Find open-source implementations

### Phase 2: Industry Analysis
1. Research existing tools and products
2. Analyze their approaches and architectures
3. Identify common patterns and best practices
4. Document limitations and gaps

### Phase 3: Validation & Synthesis
1. Compare findings with original research
2. Identify what was correctly intuited
3. Discover what was missed or misunderstood
4. Update research documents with citations

### Phase 4: Implementation Guidance
1. Select best approaches based on evidence
2. Create implementation roadmap grounded in research
3. Identify libraries and tools to leverage
4. Document risks and alternatives

## Expected Outcomes

### Immediate Benefits
- **Validation**: Confirm or refute original conceptual frameworks
- **Acceleration**: Leverage existing solutions instead of building from scratch
- **Credibility**: Ground the project in established research
- **Direction**: Clear implementation path based on proven approaches

### Research Artifacts
- Updated research documents with proper citations
- Comparison matrices for technology choices
- Literature review summaries
- Implementation recommendations based on evidence
- Risk assessments grounded in real-world experience

## Session Configuration Issue

**Note**: The `mcp__research__deepResearchReport` tool timeout needs adjustment:
- Current timeout: 30 seconds (too short for deep research)
- Recommended: 120-180 seconds for comprehensive reports
- Action needed: Adjust timeout in project configuration

## Next Session Plan

1. **Configure extended timeout** for research tools
2. **Start with Universal Patterns** research (most foundational)
3. **Progress through each topic** systematically
4. **Update research documents** with findings and citations
5. **Create synthesis document** comparing original vs. researched approaches
6. **Revise implementation plan** based on validated research

## Risk Mitigation

### Without This Research
- Risk of building solutions that already exist
- Missing critical design patterns and pitfalls
- No academic validation of approach
- Potential performance or scalability issues
- Difficulty getting buy-in without citations

### With This Research
- Build on proven foundations
- Avoid known pitfalls
- Accelerate development with existing tools
- Credible technical approach
- Clear differentiation from existing solutions
