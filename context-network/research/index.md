# CorticAI Research Index

## Purpose
This document serves as the central navigation point for all research conducted for the CorticAI project. Research is organized by functional area rather than technology, focusing on solving core problems and achieving system efficacy.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Research
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Research Philosophy

Our research prioritizes:
1. **Functionality over Performance**: Getting the concepts right before optimization
2. **User Problems over Technical Solutions**: Understanding needs before implementing
3. **Learning over Assumptions**: Testing ideas empirically rather than theoretically
4. **Simplicity over Complexity**: Preferring solutions that work over clever ones

## Research Areas

### Problem Validation
Understanding and validating the core problems CorticAI aims to solve.

**Key Questions:**
- What makes two files conceptually "the same"?
- How do developers mentally organize code knowledge?
- What context is essential vs nice-to-have?

**Documents:**
- [Deduplication Strategies](./problem_validation/deduplication_strategies.md)
- [Context Fragmentation](./problem_validation/context_fragmentation.md)
- [Multi-Perspective Access](./problem_validation/multi_perspective_access.md)

### Cognitive Models
Researching how human memory and cognition can inspire system design.

**Key Questions:**
- What should be remembered forever vs forgotten?
- How can patterns be learned without explicit training?
- What constitutes "understanding" in a context system?

**Documents:**
- [Memory Consolidation](./cognitive_models/memory_consolidation.md)
- [Attention Mechanisms](./cognitive_models/attention_mechanisms.md)
- [Learning Patterns](./cognitive_models/learning_patterns.md)

### Knowledge Representation
How to model and organize software project knowledge effectively.

**Key Questions:**
- How should contradictory information be resolved?
- What relationships matter in code understanding?
- How can we track provenance and confidence?

**Documents:**
- [Ontology Design](./knowledge_representation/ontology_design.md)
- [Relationship Modeling](./knowledge_representation/relationship_modeling.md)
- [Contradiction Handling](./knowledge_representation/contradiction_handling.md)

### User Studies
Understanding how developers and agents interact with code and context.

**Key Questions:**
- What information do developers need for different tasks?
- How can agent sessions build on previous sessions?
- What makes a context system trustworthy?

**Documents:**
- [Developer Workflows](./user_studies/developer_workflows.md)
- [Agent Patterns](./user_studies/agent_patterns.md)
- [Task Context Analysis](./user_studies/task_context_analysis.md)

### Technology Evaluation
Evaluating specific technologies for functionality rather than performance.

**Key Questions:**
- Does this technology solve our core problems?
- How does it fail gracefully?
- What's the migration path if needed?

**Documents:**
- [Graph Database Evaluation](./technology/graph_database_evaluation.md)
- [File Monitoring Solutions](./technology/file_monitoring_solutions.md)
- [Parser Comparison](./technology/parser_comparison.md)

### Integration Strategies
How to meaningfully connect with external systems.

**Key Questions:**
- How can external context be meaningfully integrated?
- What's the minimal context needed for effective assistance?
- How to handle contradictory information from different sources?

**Documents:**
- [External System Integration](./integration/external_system_integration.md)
- [Synchronization Patterns](./integration/synchronization_patterns.md)
- [Truth Source Management](./integration/truth_source_management.md)

## Research Methodology

### For Each Research Area

1. **Problem Definition**: Clear statement of what we're trying to solve
2. **Literature Review**: What others have tried and learned
3. **Hypothesis Formation**: Our proposed approach
4. **Prototype Testing**: Small-scale validation
5. **Failure Analysis**: What doesn't work and why
6. **Success Patterns**: What works consistently
7. **Decision Documentation**: ADR for chosen approach

### Research Outputs

Each research effort produces:
- **Findings Document**: What we learned
- **Prototype Code**: Proof of concept implementations
- **Decision Record**: Why we chose specific approaches
- **Risk Assessment**: What could go wrong and mitigations
- **Integration Guide**: How to implement in the main system
