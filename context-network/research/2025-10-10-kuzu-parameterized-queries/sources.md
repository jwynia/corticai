## Source Consensus Analysis

### Strong Agreement On

**1. Parameterized Queries Are Essential**
- **Consensus:** 100% of authoritative sources
- **Sources:** Kuzu docs, Neo4j KB, OWASP, Amazon Neptune
- **Key Quote (Kuzu):** "It is generally a good practice to provide parameters to your Cypher queries instead of using concatenated string queries to avoid security issues."

**2. Variable-Length Path Bounds Cannot Be Parameterized**
- **Consensus:** Confirmed by all graph database vendors
- **Sources:** Kuzu maintainers, Neo4j forums, Stack Overflow
- **Key Quote (Kuzu Maintainer):** "Parameterizing the number of hops isn't supported in openCypher, which Kuzu follows. We don't plan on supporting syntax that deviates from openCypher's standard."

**3. Input Validation Is Critical for Structural Elements**
- **Consensus:** Universal agreement across security sources
- **Sources:** OWASP, Neo4j KB, security researchers
- **Pattern:** Validate strictly before using literals in query structure

### Divergent Views On

**1. Severity of Cypher Injection Risk**
- **High Risk:** Pentester Land, security researchers emphasize exploitation potential
- **Moderate Risk:** Kuzu/Neo4j docs acknowledge risk but emphasize parameterization solves it
- **Resolution:** Risk is high IF parameterization not used, low IF used correctly
- **Impact:** Reinforces importance of proper implementation

**2. Escape Functions as Fallback**
- **Some Sources:** Suggest escape functions as backup
- **Best Practice:** Escape functions insufficient, use parameterization
- **Resolution:** Escape functions are last resort, not primary defense
- **Project Decision:** CorticAI uses parameterization primarily

**3. Need for APOC-like Procedures**
- **Neo4j Community:** APOC widely used for dynamic queries
- **Kuzu Community:** Not available, community divided on need
- **Resolution:** Optional feature, not security requirement
- **Impact:** Current approach sufficient without procedural extensions

### Gaps in Literature

**1. Comprehensive Security Testing Guide**
- **Missing:** Step-by-step guide for Cypher injection testing
- **Available:** General SQL injection testing (OWASP)
- **Workaround:** Adapt SQL injection tests to Cypher
- **Impact:** Had to create own test suite

**2. Performance Comparison: Parameters vs Literals**
- **Missing:** Benchmarks comparing parameterized vs literal queries
- **Theory:** Parameters should be faster (plan reuse)
- **Practice:** No hard data found
- **Impact:** Minor - security outweighs performance concerns

**3. Kuzu-Specific Security Best Practices**
- **Missing:** Kuzu-specific security documentation
- **Available:** General Cypher security from Neo4j
- **Workaround:** Apply Neo4j best practices to Kuzu
- **Impact:** Successfully adapted patterns

**4. Variable-Length Path Validation Patterns**
- **Missing:** Specific guidance on validating path depths
- **Available:** General input validation guides
- **Workaround:** Created validation based on OWASP principles
- **Impact:** Required original design work
