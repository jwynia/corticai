# Memory Consolidation Research

## Purpose
This document researches how human memory consolidation patterns can inspire the design of CorticAI's knowledge management system, particularly the three-tier memory architecture.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Research/Cognitive Models
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Conceptual
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Cognitive Science Background

### Human Memory Systems

**Working Memory:**
- Limited capacity (7±2 items)
- Short duration (seconds to minutes)
- Active manipulation of information
- Gateway to long-term storage

**Long-term Memory:**
- Semantic: Facts and concepts
- Episodic: Personal experiences
- Procedural: How to do things
- Unlimited capacity

**Consolidation Process:**
- Occurs during sleep/rest
- Transfers working → long-term
- Strengthens important patterns
- Discards noise

## Application to Context Systems

### Three-Tier Architecture Mapping

```typescript
interface MemoryArchitecture {
  // Tier 1: Working Memory (Hot)
  working: {
    capacity: 'limited'  // Recent changes only
    duration: 'session'  // Cleared after consolidation
    access: 'immediate'  // No query needed
    content: {
      recentChanges: Change[]
      activePatterns: Pattern[]
      currentContext: Context
      uncertainties: Question[]
    }
  }
  
  // Tier 2: Semantic Memory (Warm)
  semantic: {
    capacity: 'large'  // Established knowledge
    duration: 'permanent'  // Until explicitly removed
    access: 'indexed'  // Query required
    content: {
      concepts: Concept[]
      relationships: Relationship[]
      patterns: Pattern[]
      rules: Rule[]
    }
  }
  
  // Tier 3: Episodic Archive (Cold)
  episodic: {
    capacity: 'unlimited'  // Complete history
    duration: 'forever'  // Never deleted
    access: 'search'  // Deep search required
    content: {
      events: Event[]
      versions: Version[]
      decisions: Decision[]
      failures: Attempt[]
    }
  }
}
```

### Consolidation Process Design

#### When to Consolidate

**Triggers:**
- Quiet period (no activity for X minutes)
- Memory pressure (working memory full)
- Session end (agent completion)
- Scheduled (nightly/hourly)
- Manual request

**Process:**
```typescript
interface ConsolidationProcess {
  // Step 1: Pattern Extraction
  extract: {
    identify: Pattern[]  // Find repeated patterns
    abstract: Concept[]  // Extract general concepts
    connect: Relationship[]  // Identify relationships
  }
  
  // Step 2: Importance Scoring
  score: {
    frequency: number  // How often seen
    recency: number  // How recently accessed
    connectivity: number  // How many connections
    confidence: number  // How certain we are
  }
  
  // Step 3: Integration
  integrate: {
    merge: (existing, new) => unified
    resolve: (conflicts) => resolution
    strengthen: (pattern) => reinforced
    prune: (weak) => removed
  }
  
  // Step 4: Archive
  archive: {
    snapshot: EpisodicRecord
    compress: CompressedData
    index: SearchableMetadata
    provenance: SourceTracking
  }
}
```

## Research Findings

### What to Remember vs Forget

#### Always Remember
- **Decisions**: Why things were done
- **Failures**: What didn't work and why
- **Patterns**: Recurring successful approaches
- **Relationships**: How things connect
- **Contradictions**: Conflicting information

#### Selective Memory
- **Details**: Keep if frequently accessed
- **Iterations**: Keep final + key intermediates
- **Discussions**: Keep decisions, not noise
- **Versions**: Keep significant changes

#### Safe to Forget
- **Redundancy**: Duplicate information
- **Noise**: Uncommitted changes
- **Temporary**: Build artifacts
- **Resolved**: Fixed issues

### Consolidation Strategies

#### 1. Frequency-Based
```typescript
if (accessCount > threshold) {
  promoteToSemantic()
} else if (age > limit && accessCount === 0) {
  archiveToEpisodic()
}
```

#### 2. Pattern-Based
```typescript
if (matchesEstablishedPattern()) {
  strengthenPattern()
  archiveInstance()
} else if (isNewPattern()) {
  tentativelyAddToSemantic()
  trackForValidation()
}
```

#### 3. Importance-Based
```typescript
importance = 
  connectivity * 0.3 +
  uniqueness * 0.3 +
  frequency * 0.2 +
  recency * 0.2

if (importance > threshold) {
  keepInSemantic()
}
```

## Sleep-Inspired Algorithms

### REM Sleep Analog
- Random replay of recent memories
- Find unexpected connections
- Strengthen important pathways
- Prune weak connections

```typescript
function remConsolidation() {
  const recent = selectRandom(workingMemory)
  const related = findRelated(semanticMemory, recent)
  
  for (const item of recent) {
    const connections = findConnections(item, related)
    if (connections.strength > threshold) {
      strengthen(connections)
      promoteToSemantic(item)
    }
  }
}
```

### Deep Sleep Analog
- Systematic consolidation
- Transfer to long-term storage
- Clear working memory
- Restore capacity

```typescript
function deepConsolidation() {
  const patterns = extractPatterns(workingMemory)
  
  for (const pattern of patterns) {
    const existing = findSimilar(semanticMemory, pattern)
    if (existing) {
      merge(existing, pattern)
    } else {
      addToSemantic(pattern)
    }
  }
  
  archiveToEpisodic(workingMemory)
  clear(workingMemory)
}
```

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1: Basic Consolidation
- Simple frequency-based promotion
- Time-based archival
- Manual trigger only
- Learn patterns

### Phase 2: Smart Consolidation
- Pattern recognition
- Importance scoring
- Automatic triggers
- Conflict resolution

### Phase 3: Adaptive Consolidation
- Learn from usage
- Predict importance
- Optimize timing
- Cross-project patterns

## Open Questions

1. How to determine "quiet periods" in continuous systems?
2. What's the optimal working memory size?
3. How to handle conflicting consolidations?
4. Should consolidation be reversible?
5. How to consolidate across projects?

## Success Metrics

- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced working memory size
- **Knowledge Retention**: Important info preserved
- **Access Speed**: Fast retrieval of relevant info
- **Pattern Recognition**: Successful pattern identification
