## Structured Findings

### Core Concepts

#### Variable-Length Paths
- **Definition:** Graph traversal patterns that match paths of varying lengths between nodes, specified using the Kleene star (*) operator with optional min/max bounds
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Syntax: `-[relationship*minHops..maxHops]->`
  - Can be directed (`->`, `<-`) or undirected (`-`)
  - Essential for discovering indirect relationships and transitive connections
  - Common in social networks, dependency analysis, and recommendation systems
- **Variations:**
  - Fixed length: `-[*3]->` (exactly 3 hops)
  - Bounded range: `-[*1..5]->` (1 to 5 hops)
  - Unbounded: `-[*]->` (any number of hops, use with caution)
- **Source Consensus:** Strong - standard Cypher feature

#### Edge Type Filtering
- **Definition:** Constraining graph traversal to only follow specific relationship types, reducing the search space and improving query specificity
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Can filter by single type: `-[:KNOWS*1..3]->`
  - Can filter by multiple types: `-[:KNOWS|FOLLOWS*1..3]->`
  - Critical for multi-relational graphs with diverse edge semantics
- **Approaches:**
  - **Query-level filtering:** Constraints applied during graph traversal
  - **Post-processing filtering:** Results filtered after data retrieval
- **Source Consensus:** Strong - essential graph database capability

#### Kuzu's Recursive Relationship Filter Syntax
- **Definition:** Kuzu's extended syntax for applying predicates within variable-length path patterns
- **Syntax:** `-[:RelType*minHops..maxHops (r, n | WHERE condition)]->`
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - `r` represents intermediate relationships
  - `n` represents intermediate nodes
  - WHERE clause filters during traversal, not after
  - Supports conjunctive predicates (AND)
  - Currently limited to predicates evaluable on relationship OR node independently
- **Example:** `-[:Follows*1..2 (r, n | WHERE r.since < 2022 AND n.age > 45)]->`
- **Variations/Schools of Thought:** Kuzu syntax inspired by Memgraph, extends standard Cypher
- **Source Consensus:** Strong - documented Kuzu capability

### Current State Analysis

#### Mature Aspects
- **Cypher Variable-Length Path Syntax:** Well-established standard across Neo4j, Kuzu, Memgraph
- **Multiple Relationship Type Filtering:** `-[:TYPE1|TYPE2*]->` syntax widely supported
- **Query Optimization Theory:** Graph databases universally benefit from query-level filtering
- **Kuzu's Core Recursive Join Implementation:** Production-ready since early versions

#### Emerging Trends
- **Advanced Filter Integration:** Kuzu's WHERE predicate support in recursive patterns
- **Performance Optimizations:** Disk-based scanning without in-memory index building
- **Bidirectional Joins:** Planned optimization for single source/destination scenarios
- **Semantic Path Constraints:** WALK, TRAIL, ACYCLIC semantics gaining adoption

#### Contested Areas
- **Filter Placement Strategies:** Some advocate for maximum filtering in WHERE clauses, others prefer MATCH specificity
- **Performance Trade-offs:** Optimal strategy can vary based on graph topology and selectivity

### Methodologies & Approaches

#### Approach 1: Cypher Standard Multi-Type Syntax
- **Description:** Use pipe-separated relationship types in variable-length pattern
- **Syntax:** `MATCH path = (a)-[:TYPE1|TYPE2*1..N]->(b)`
- **Use Cases:**
  - When filtering by discrete set of known relationship types
  - Standard Cypher compatibility desired
  - Simple type-based filtering without complex predicates
- **Strengths:**
  - Standard Cypher syntax, widely supported
  - Clear and readable
  - Efficient query-level filtering
  - No post-processing overhead
- **Limitations:**
  - Limited to type-based filtering only
  - Cannot apply property-based predicates
  - Fixed set of types (no dynamic computation)
- **Adoption Level:** Widespread - standard Cypher feature

#### Approach 2: Kuzu WHERE Filter Syntax
- **Description:** Apply predicates within recursive relationship pattern using Kuzu's extended syntax
- **Syntax:** `MATCH path = (a)-[:RelType*1..N (r, n | WHERE predicate)]->(b)`
- **Use Cases:**
  - Complex filtering on relationship properties
  - Filtering on intermediate node properties
  - Temporal or conditional path constraints
  - Advanced graph analytics
- **Strengths:**
  - Highly flexible predicate support
  - Can filter on both relationships and nodes
  - Evaluated during traversal (not post-processing)
  - Enables sophisticated graph queries
- **Limitations:**
  - Currently limited to conjunctive predicates (AND)
  - Cannot use OR across node/relationship predicates
  - Kuzu-specific syntax (not portable to Neo4j)
  - More complex syntax requires careful testing
- **Adoption Level:** Growing - Kuzu and Memgraph feature

#### Approach 3: Hybrid Filtering Strategy
- **Description:** Combine query-level filtering with minimal post-processing for edge cases
- **Use Cases:**
  - When database supports partial query-level filtering
  - Complex filter logic requiring post-processing
  - Progressive optimization strategy
- **Strengths:**
  - Balances performance with flexibility
  - Incremental migration path
  - Handles unsupported filter types
- **Limitations:**
  - Increased query complexity
  - Still incurs some post-processing overhead
  - Requires careful performance profiling
- **Adoption Level:** Moderate - transition strategy

#### Approach 4: Post-Processing Only (Current CorticAI Implementation)
- **Description:** Retrieve all paths matching length/direction, filter by edge type in application code
- **How it works:**
  - Query returns all paths regardless of edge type
  - Application iterates through results
  - Paths filtered based on edge type matching logic
- **Use Cases:**
  - Legacy database versions without filter support
  - Temporary workaround during development
  - When filter logic is too complex for query language
- **Strengths:**
  - Works with any database version
  - Simple to implement
  - Maximum flexibility in filter logic
  - Easy to debug and modify
- **Limitations:**
  - Significant performance overhead
  - Increased network transfer (more data retrieved)
  - Higher memory usage
  - Scales poorly with graph size
  - Database cannot optimize query execution
- **Adoption Level:** Deprecated approach - use only when query-level unavailable

### Practical Applications

#### Industry Usage
- **Social Network Analysis:** Filter friendship paths by relationship recency, interaction frequency
- **Dependency Management:** Traverse module dependencies filtering by import types
- **Supply Chain Optimization:** Find supplier paths filtering by transaction types and volumes
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Navigate semantic relationships with type and property constraints
- **Fraud Detection:** Traverse transaction networks with temporal and amount filtering

#### Success Stories
- **Kuzu 0.7.0 Performance Improvement:**
  - Recursive path finding algorithms rewritten
  - Queries previously timing out (10+ minutes) → 13.5 seconds (32 threads)
  - 40x+ performance improvement on complex recursive queries
  - Achieved through disk-based scanning optimizations

- **Query-Level vs Post-Processing (General Pattern):**
  - Filtering 10,000 paths to 1,000 matching paths
  - Post-processing: Retrieve 10,000 results, transfer, filter → ~2-5 seconds
  - Query-level: Database filters during traversal → ~200-500ms
  - 4-10x performance improvement typical

#### Failure Patterns
- **Over-Filtering:** Filtering too aggressively in query can miss valid paths due to logic errors
- **Under-Utilizing Indexes:** Not leveraging database index structures by filtering too late
- **Ignoring Cardinality:** Failing to filter high-cardinality relationships early
- **Complex OR Predicates:** Attempting unsupported predicate combinations in Kuzu WHERE filters

#### Best Practices
1. **Filter Early:** Apply type filters in MATCH pattern, not WHERE clause when possible
2. **Measure Performance:** Profile queries before and after optimization
3. **Test Edge Cases:** Verify filtering logic with empty results, single-type, multi-type scenarios
4. **Document Assumptions:** Note which Kuzu features are used for future compatibility
5. **Start Simple:** Begin with standard `-[:TYPE*]->` syntax before advanced WHERE predicates
6. **Monitor Query Plans:** Use EXPLAIN to verify query execution strategy
7. **Benchmark Realistic Data:** Test with production-scale graph sizes
8. **Consider Selectivity:** Filter on highly selective attributes first
