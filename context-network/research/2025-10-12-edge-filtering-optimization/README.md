# Edge Filtering Optimization Research - Summary

**Research Date:** 2025-10-12
**Research Type:** Performance Optimization Investigation
**Status:** ✅ Complete - Ready for Implementation
**Priority:** HIGH

## Quick Summary

Research confirms that Kuzu (version 0.11.x series) supports query-level edge type filtering in variable-length graph paths, which can provide **2-10x+ performance improvement** over the current post-processing approach used in CorticAI.

## Key Findings

### 1. Kuzu Supports Multiple Edge Filtering Approaches ✅

**Standard Cypher Syntax:**
```cypher
MATCH path = (a)-[:TYPE1|TYPE2*1..N]->(b)
```

**Kuzu Advanced Syntax:**
```cypher
MATCH path = (a)-[:RelType*1..N (r, n | WHERE condition)]->(b)
```

### 2. Significant Performance Benefits ✅

- **Query-level filtering:** Database filters during traversal
- **Post-processing (current):** Application filters after data retrieval
- **Expected improvement:** 2-10x faster (potentially 40x+ based on Kuzu benchmarks)
- **Additional benefits:** Reduced memory usage, lower network transfer

### 3. Implementation is Straightforward ✅

- **Effort:** 2-3 hours implementation + testing
- **Risk:** Low - minimal code changes, comprehensive tests exist
- **Compatibility:** Kuzu 0.11.x confirmed to support feature
- **Migration:** Clear path from post-processing to query-level

## Recommendation

**✅ Implement query-level edge type filtering immediately.** The performance benefits are significant, the implementation is straightforward, and the risk is minimal.

## Implementation Path

### Phase 1: Standard Multi-Type Filtering (Recommended First Step)
1. Update `KuzuSecureQueryBuilder.buildTraversalQuery()` to include edge type filter
2. Remove post-processing filter from `KuzuStorageAdapter.traverse()`
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Measure performance improvement

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**Expected Performance Gain:** 2-10x

### Phase 2: Advanced WHERE Filtering (Future Enhancement)
- Use Kuzu's WHERE predicate syntax for complex filtering
- Filter by relationship properties, node properties
- Requires Kuzu-specific syntax (not portable)

**Estimated Time:** 2-3 hours
**When Needed:** If property-based filtering required
