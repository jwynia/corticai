# Next Sprint Plan

## Sprint Overview
**Sprint Goal**: Close documentation gaps and advance domain adapter framework
**Duration**: 1-2 weeks
**Priority**: Documentation alignment then implementation advancement

## Selected Tasks (From Groomed Backlog)

### Week 1: Documentation Alignment

#### 1. Create Comprehensive Discovery Records
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Assignee**: Available
**Priority**: HIGH

**Description**: Document the major implemented components (Progressive Loading, Lens System, NovelAdapter) in proper discovery records.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Create `discoveries/locations/progressive-loading.md`
- [ ] Create `discoveries/locations/lens-system.md`
- [ ] Create `discoveries/locations/novel-adapter.md`
- [ ] Update location indexes
- [ ] Cross-link related concepts

**Files to Create/Modify**:
- `context-network/discoveries/locations/progressive-loading.md`
- `context-network/discoveries/locations/lens-system.md`
- `context-network/discoveries/locations/novel-adapter.md`
- Related index files

#### 2. Assess Current Development Phase
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Assignee**: Available
**Priority**: HIGH

**Description**: Determine actual current phase (likely Phase 4+) and update roadmap to reflect implementation reality.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Review implementation completeness of Phases 1-3
- [ ] Assess Phase 4 (Domain Adapters) progress
- [ ] Update `planning/roadmap.md` with reality-based phases
- [ ] Document phase transition criteria
- [ ] Update milestone tracking

**Files to Modify**:
- `context-network/planning/roadmap.md`
- `context-network/planning/milestones.md`

### Week 2: Implementation Advancement

#### 3. Update System Architecture Documentation
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Assignee**: Available
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Prerequisites**: Discovery records complete

**Description**: Reflect Progressive Loading and Lens System integration in architecture documentation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Update `architecture/system_architecture.md` with progressive loading
- [ ] Document lens system integration in `architecture/component_map.md`
- [ ] Update `architecture/data_architecture.md` with depth-aware queries
- [ ] Reflect new components in `architecture/integration_patterns.md`

**Files to Modify**:
- `context-network/architecture/system_architecture.md`
- `context-network/architecture/component_map.md`
- `context-network/architecture/data_architecture.md`
- `context-network/architecture/integration_patterns.md`

---

#### 4. Complete CodebaseAdapter Implementation (Optional)
**Effort**: 4-6 hours
**Assignee**: Available
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of adapter patterns

**Description**: Complete the CodebaseAdapter implementation to prove domain adapter pattern scalability.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Complete CodebaseAdapter implementation
- [ ] Implement TypeScript AST parsing
- [ ] Add import/export dependency tracking
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add usage examples

**Files to Modify**:
- `app/src/adapters/CodebaseAdapter.ts`
- `app/tests/adapters/codebase.test.ts`
- Example and documentation files

---

## Sprint Success Criteria

### Minimum Success (Week 1)
- [ ] Discovery records created and linked
- [ ] Current phase accurately documented
- [ ] Planning documents aligned with reality

### Full Success (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Architecture documentation updated
- [ ] Clear path to next phase implementation
- [ ] Knowledge management gaps closed

### Stretch Goal (Week 2)
- [ ] CodebaseAdapter implementation complete
- [ ] Domain adapter pattern proven scalable

## Sprint Metrics

**Target Outcomes**:
- Documentation drift eliminated
- Team understanding of current state improved
- Clear next phase priorities established
- Adapter framework validated (if CodebaseAdapter completed)

**Success Indicators**:
- New team members can understand current state from docs
- Architecture reflects actual implementation
- Next sprint planning is reality-based

## Risk Mitigation

**Low Risk Tasks** (Week 1):
- Discovery records: Documentation only, no code changes
- Phase assessment: Strategic planning, reversible

**Medium Risk Tasks** (Week 2):
- Architecture updates: Documentation with cross-references
- CodebaseAdapter: New implementation, comprehensive testing required

## Notes

This sprint prioritizes closing the documentation gap identified during the grooming process. The sync/groom cycle revealed that implementation was ahead of documentation, so focus on alignment before advancing further.

**Next Sprint Preview**: Depending on completion, next sprint would likely focus on Phase 5 features (pattern detection, external integrations) or production readiness assessment.
