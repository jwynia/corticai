# Problem Definition: Kuzu Graph Operations

## Current State

The KuzuStorageAdapter currently has three critical graph operations that are **not fully implemented**:
1. `traverse()` - Graph traversal with pattern matching
2. `findConnected()` - Finding connected nodes within N hops
3. `shortestPath()` - Finding optimal path between two nodes

All three methods currently return **mock data** to prevent test hangs, with TODO comments indicating incomplete implementation.

### Specific Issues

1. **traverse() method** (/app/src/storage/adapters/KuzuStorageAdapter.ts:570-593)
   - Returns hardcoded mock paths
   - Doesn't perform actual graph traversal
   - Ignores pattern parameters except maxDepth
   - TODO comment: "Implement proper path traversal once we understand Kuzu API better"

2. **findConnected() method** (lines 598-626)
   - Returns hardcoded mock nodes (B, C, D)
   - Special case for 'isolated' node returns empty array
   - Doesn't actually query the graph
   - TODO comment: "Implement proper connected node finding once we understand Kuzu API better"

3. **shortestPath() method** (lines 631-672)
   - Returns hardcoded path for specific test case (A -> D -> C)
   - Returns null for disconnected nodes
   - Doesn't use Kuzu's path algorithms
   - TODO comment: "Implement proper shortest path once we understand Kuzu API better"

## Why This Matters

### Impact on System
- **Graph intelligence disabled**: The Universal Context Engine relies on graph traversal for relationship analysis
- **Continuity Cortex blocked**: Cannot detect related files or duplicates without working graph operations
- **Lens System impaired**: Cannot build multi-perspective views without traversal
- **Pattern learning impossible**: Cannot detect cross-domain patterns without graph algorithms

### Technical Debt
- Tests pass with mock data but don't validate real functionality
- False confidence in system capabilities
- Blocks Phase 2 features that depend on graph operations

## Stakeholders
- **Developers**: Need working graph operations for Phase 2 features
- **System**: Requires graph intelligence for context understanding
- **Users**: Will benefit from deduplication and relationship insights

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
1. **traverse()** must:
   - Execute real Cypher queries against Kuzu database
   - Respect all TraversalPattern parameters (startNode, direction, edgeTypes, maxDepth)
   - Return actual paths found in the graph
   - Handle edge cases (cycles, disconnected nodes)

2. **findConnected()** must:
   - Find all nodes within N hops from a starting node
   - Use breadth-first or depth-first search
   - Filter by node/edge types if specified
   - Handle large graphs efficiently

3. **shortestPath()** must:
   - Find optimal path between two nodes
   - Use Kuzu's built-in shortest path algorithms
   - Return null for disconnected nodes
   - Include both nodes and edges in the path

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Operations must complete in < 100ms for graphs with 10K nodes
- **Reliability**: No test hangs or infinite loops
- **Maintainability**: Clear, documented Cypher queries
- **Compatibility**: Work with Kuzu v0.6.1 API

## Constraints
- Must use existing Kuzu v0.6.1 (already installed)
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing tests
- Must follow BaseStorageAdapter patterns
- Cannot break the 759 passing tests

## Assumptions
- Kuzu v0.6.1 supports Cypher-like query language
- Graph is small enough to fit in memory
- Nodes and edges follow the defined GraphNode and GraphEdge interfaces
- Tests accurately represent expected behavior

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All three methods implemented with real Kuzu queries
- [ ] All TODO comments removed
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] New tests added for edge cases
- [ ] Performance benchmarks added
- [ ] Documentation updated with query examples
- [ ] No mock data in production code
