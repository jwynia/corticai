## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (2 hours)
- [ ] Verify Kuzu connection
- [ ] Test simple query execution
- [ ] Implement helper methods
- [ ] Add string escaping
- [ ] Set up logging

### Phase 2: Core Implementation (4-5 hours)
- [ ] Implement traverse() method
- [ ] Implement findConnected() method
- [ ] Implement shortestPath() method
- [ ] Add error handling
- [ ] Remove TODO comments

### Phase 3: Testing & Validation (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Run existing tests
- [ ] Fix any failures
- [ ] Add edge case tests
- [ ] Run performance benchmarks
- [ ] Validate memory usage

### Phase 4: Documentation & Cleanup (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Update JSDoc comments
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Update README if needed
- [ ] Code review preparation
- [ ] Final test run

## Quality Gates

### Before Starting
- [ ] All prerequisites met
- [ ] Risks understood and mitigated
- [ ] Time allocated and available
- [ ] Rollback plan ready

### During Implementation
- [ ] Tests run after each method
- [ ] Performance monitored
- [ ] Memory usage checked
- [ ] Errors handled properly

### Before Completion
- [ ] All 759 tests passing
- [ ] No TODO comments remain
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] Performance acceptable
- [ ] Code review passed

## Go/No-Go Decision

### Go Criteria (All must be true)
- [ ] Kuzu connection can be established
- [ ] Simple queries execute successfully
- [ ] Developer has 10-12 hours available
- [ ] Rollback plan is ready
- [ ] Tests can be run locally

### No-Go Criteria (Any being true stops implementation)
- [ ] Kuzu API significantly different than documented
- [ ] Cannot establish database connection
- [ ] Critical production issues need attention
- [ ] Less than 8 hours available
- [ ] No rollback possibility

## Final Checklist

### Ready to Implement When:
1. [ ] Problem fully understood
2. [ ] Solution approach validated
3. [ ] Risks assessed and mitigated
4. [ ] Resources available
5. [ ] Success criteria defined
6. [ ] Testing strategy ready
7. [ ] Documentation plan clear
8. [ ] Rollback plan prepared

## Sign-off

### Technical Lead
- [ ] Architecture approved
- [ ] Risk assessment reviewed
- [ ] Resource allocation confirmed

### Development Team
- [ ] Implementation approach understood
- [ ] Time commitment available
- [ ] Questions answered

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test strategy approved
- [ ] Performance criteria agreed
- [ ] Edge cases identified

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Verify Kuzu connection with test script
2. **Before coding**: Run performance baseline
3. **First task**: Implement helper methods
4. **Regular**: Run tests after each method
5. **Final**: Complete documentation and review

## Notes

- Keep mock implementations commented for emergency rollback
- Start with simplest method (shortestPath) if uncertain
- Add extensive logging initially, remove after validation
- Consider pair programming for complex queries
- Schedule code review before merging
