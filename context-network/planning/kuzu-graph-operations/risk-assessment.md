# Risk Assessment: Kuzu Graph Operations

## Risk Register

### Risk 1: Kuzu API Incompatibility

**Description**: The actual Kuzu v0.6.1 API might differ from documentation, causing implementation failures.

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High
**Risk Score**: 6/9

**Mitigation**:
- Start with simplest queries first
- Test incrementally with console logging
- Have fallback to mock implementation if critical
- Keep existing mock code commented for emergency rollback

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Connection.query() method not found
- Different result structure than expected
- Unexpected error messages

**Contingency Plan**:
- Investigate actual Kuzu Node.js API through node_modules
- Check Kuzu GitHub issues for v0.6.1 specifics
- Consider upgrading Kuzu if API is significantly different

---

### Risk 2: Performance Degradation

**Description**: Real graph queries might be significantly slower than mock returns, causing test timeouts.

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Risk Score**: 4/9

**Mitigation**:
- Add LIMIT clauses to all queries
- Set reasonable depth limits (max 10)
- Implement query timeouts
- Add performance logging from the start

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Test execution time increases
- CI/CD pipeline timeouts
- Memory usage spikes

**Contingency Plan**:
- Optimize queries with better Cypher patterns
- Add query result caching
- Reduce default depth limits
- Consider connection pooling

---

### Risk 3: Test Regression

**Description**: Existing tests might fail due to differences between mock and real data.

**Probability**: High
**Impact**: Low
**Risk Score**: 3/9

**Mitigation**:
- Review test expectations before implementation
- Ensure test data setup creates expected graph structure
- Keep mock behavior for specific test scenarios
- Run tests frequently during development

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Test failures in CI/CD
- Different result ordering than expected
- Missing or extra nodes in results

**Contingency Plan**:
- Update test expectations to match real behavior
- Add test data setup to ensure consistent graph state
- Make tests more flexible about result ordering

---

### Risk 4: Query Injection Vulnerabilities

**Description**: Improper string escaping could allow Cypher injection attacks.

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: High
**Risk Score**: 3/9

**Mitigation**:
- Implement proper string escaping function
- Use parameterized queries if supported
- Validate input types and ranges
- Add security tests for injection attempts

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Query errors with special characters
- Unexpected query results
- Security scanner warnings

**Contingency Plan**:
- Switch to parameterized queries
- Add input validation layer
- Implement query whitelisting
- Security review before production

---

### Risk 5: Memory Leaks

**Description**: Large graph traversals might cause memory issues.

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: High
**Risk Score**: 3/9

**Mitigation**:
- Always use LIMIT clauses
- Stream results for large datasets
- Monitor memory usage in tests
- Set maximum result size limits

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Increasing memory usage over time
- Out of memory errors
- Slow garbage collection

**Contingency Plan**:
- Implement result streaming
- Add memory limits to queries
- Use pagination for large results
- Implement connection recycling

---

### Risk 6: Breaking API Changes

**Description**: Changes might break downstream components using these methods.

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Medium
**Risk Score**: 2/9

**Mitigation**:
- Maintain exact same method signatures
- Return same data structures
- Keep backward compatibility
- Add deprecation warnings for changes

**Early Warning Signs**:
- TypeScript compilation errors
- Integration test failures
- Consumer component errors

**Contingency Plan**:
- Add adapter layer for compatibility
- Version the API changes
- Provide migration guide
- Gradual rollout with feature flags

---

### Risk 7: Circular Dependencies

**Description**: Graph cycles might cause infinite loops in traversal.

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Low
**Risk Score**: 2/9

**Mitigation**:
- Use Kuzu's built-in cycle handling
- Set maximum depth limits
- Use ACYCLIC path semantics where appropriate
- Add cycle detection tests

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Queries taking too long
- Stack overflow errors
- Test timeouts

**Contingency Plan**:
- Switch to ACYCLIC path mode
- Reduce depth limits
- Add visited node tracking
- Implement query timeouts

---

### Risk 8: Database Lock Issues

**Description**: Concurrent operations might cause database locking issues.

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Low
**Risk Score**: 1/9

**Mitigation**:
- Use read-only queries for graph operations
- Implement connection pooling
- Add retry logic for lock failures
- Monitor lock contention

**Early Warning Signs**:
- Intermittent query failures
- "Database locked" errors
- Slow query execution

**Contingency Plan**:
- Add transaction management
- Implement queue for write operations
- Add exponential backoff retry
- Consider read replicas

## Overall Risk Assessment

**Overall Risk Level**: MEDIUM

**Key Risks**:
1. API compatibility (R1) - Highest priority
2. Performance degradation (R2) - Monitor closely
3. Test regression (R3) - Expected but manageable

**Confidence Level**: HIGH
- Clear implementation path
- Good documentation available
- Fallback options exist
- Limited scope of changes

## Recommendations

### Before Implementation
1. Verify Kuzu v0.6.1 API with simple test script
2. Benchmark current mock performance
3. Review all affected tests
4. Set up performance monitoring

### During Implementation
1. Test each method incrementally
2. Keep mock code commented for rollback
3. Add extensive logging initially
4. Run tests frequently

### After Implementation
