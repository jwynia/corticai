# Kuzu Graph Operations - Planning Summary

## Overview
This planning package addresses the completion of three critical graph operations in KuzuStorageAdapter that currently return mock data instead of performing real graph queries.

## Problem Statement
The KuzuStorageAdapter has three TODO-marked methods that return hardcoded mock data:
- `traverse()` - Returns fake paths instead of actual graph traversal
- `findConnected()` - Returns hardcoded nodes instead of finding connected nodes
- `shortestPath()` - Returns mock path instead of calculating shortest path

This blocks Phase 2 of the Universal Context Engine, particularly the Continuity Cortex which requires working graph operations for deduplication and relationship analysis.

## Solution Approach

### Core Strategy
Replace mock implementations with real Kuzu Cypher queries while maintaining backward compatibility with existing tests.

### Implementation Plan
1. **Helper Methods** (1 hour) - Foundation utilities for all operations
2. **traverse() Method** (2-3 hours) - Most complex, pattern-based traversal
3. **findConnected() Method** (1-2 hours) - BFS to find nodes within N hops
4. **shortestPath() Method** (1-2 hours) - Kuzu's SHORTEST algorithm
5. **Testing & Validation** (2-3 hours) - Ensure all 759 tests pass
6. **Documentation** (1 hour) - Remove TODOs, add examples

**Total Estimated Time**: 10-12 hours

## Key Technical Decisions

### Query Patterns
- Use Cypher standard syntax compatible with Kuzu v0.6.1
- Implement proper string escaping to prevent injection
- Add LIMIT clauses to prevent runaway queries
- Set maximum depth of 10 for all traversals

### Error Handling
- Wrap all Kuzu errors in StorageError with appropriate codes
- Handle disconnected nodes gracefully (empty results or null)
- Add query timeouts to prevent hangs
- Log queries in debug mode for troubleshooting

### Performance Constraints
- Queries must complete in < 100ms for 10K node graphs
- Default result limit of 100-1000 depending on operation
- Use DISTINCT to prevent duplicate results
- Leverage Entity.id PRIMARY KEY index

## Risk Summary

### Top Risks
1. **API Incompatibility** (Medium/High) - Kuzu API might differ from docs
2. **Performance Degradation** (Medium/Medium) - Real queries slower than mocks
3. **Test Regression** (High/Low) - Tests might fail with real data

### Mitigation Strategy
- Test Kuzu connection before implementation
- Keep mock code commented for rollback
- Run tests incrementally during development
- Add performance monitoring from start

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
- ✅ All three methods use real Kuzu queries
- ✅ All 759 existing tests pass
- ✅ No TODO comments remain
- ✅ Queries complete in < 100ms

### Should Have
- ✅ Edge case tests added
- ✅ Performance benchmarks established
- ✅ JSDoc documentation complete
- ✅ Usage examples created

### Could Have
- Query result caching
- Advanced path semantics (TRAIL, ACYCLIC)
- Weighted shortest path
- Query performance logging

## Implementation Readiness

### Prerequisites Met
- ✅ Kuzu v0.6.1 installed
- ✅ Graph schema established
- ✅ Test suite functional
- ✅ Implementation patterns researched

### Prerequisites Pending
- ⏳ Kuzu connection verification
- ⏳ Simple query test
- ⏳ Performance baseline
- ⏳ Developer time allocation

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Immediate Action**: Create test script to verify Kuzu connection
   ```typescript
   const db = new Database('./test.kuzu')
   const conn = new Connection(db)
   const result = await conn.query('RETURN 1 as test')
   console.log(await result.getAll())
   ```

2. **Before Implementation**:
   - Run performance baseline with mock implementations
   - Review all test expectations
   - Set up query logging

3. **Start Implementation**:
   - Begin with helper methods
   - Then implement shortestPath (simplest)
   - Save traverse for last (most complex)

## Architecture Highlights

### Query Builder Pattern
```typescript
class QueryBuilder {
  buildTraversalQuery(pattern: TraversalPattern): string
  buildConnectedQuery(nodeId: string, depth: number): string
  buildShortestPathQuery(from: string, to: string): string
}
```

### Result Transformation
```typescript
class ResultTransformer {
  toGraphPath(kuzuPath: any): GraphPath
  toGraphNode(kuzuNode: any): GraphNode
  toGraphEdge(kuzuEdge: any): GraphEdge
}
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  const result = await connection.query(cypherQuery)
  return transformer.transform(await result.getAll())
} catch (error) {
  throw new StorageError(message, code, context)
}
```

## Conclusion

This planning package provides a comprehensive blueprint for completing the Kuzu graph operations. The implementation is well-understood, risks are identified and mitigated, and a clear path forward is defined.

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - We have all the information needed for successful implementation.

**Critical Success Factor**: Verify Kuzu connection and basic query execution before starting implementation.
