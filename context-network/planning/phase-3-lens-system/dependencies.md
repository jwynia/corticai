## Critical Path Analysis

### Primary Critical Path (Week 1-5)
1. **Task 3.1** (Core Lens Interface) → **Task 3.2** (Lens Registry) → **Task 3.5** (Composition Engine) → **Task 3.6** (QueryBuilder Integration) → **Task 3.8** (Performance Optimization)

**Why Critical**: This path establishes the fundamental lens infrastructure that all other functionality depends on.

### Secondary Critical Path (Week 2-4)
1. **Task 3.3** (DebugLens) → **Task 3.4** (DocumentationLens) → **Task 3.7** (Lens Library) → **Task 3.8** (Performance Optimization)

**Why Critical**: Lens implementations are needed to validate and optimize the system architecture.

## Dependency Risk Analysis

### High Risk Dependencies

#### Risk: QueryBuilder Integration Complexity
- **Dependency**: Task 3.6 depends on complex integration with existing QueryBuilder
- **Impact**: Could delay Phase 3 completion by 1-2 weeks
- **Mitigation**:
  - Prototype integration early during Task 3.1-3.2 development
  - Maintain strict backward compatibility
  - Plan fallback to separate LensAwareQueryBuilder if integration proves difficult

#### Risk: Lens Composition Performance
- **Dependency**: Task 3.8 depends on Task 3.5 composition engine being performant
- **Impact**: Could require architectural changes if performance targets aren't met
- **Mitigation**:
  - Design composition engine with performance in mind from start
  - Implement basic benchmarking in Task 3.5
  - Plan simplified composition fallback if needed

### Medium Risk Dependencies

#### Risk: Lens Implementation Complexity
- **Dependency**: Tasks 3.3-3.4 and 3.7 require accurate pattern detection
- **Impact**: Could result in poor lens relevance and user experience
- **Mitigation**:
  - Start with simple, reliable patterns
  - Implement extensive testing for pattern detection
  - Plan iterative improvement rather than perfect initial implementation

#### Risk: Configuration System Complexity
- **Dependency**: Task 3.9 depends on stable configuration for all previous components
- **Impact**: Could create deployment and maintenance challenges
- **Mitigation**:
  - Keep configuration simple and focused
  - Provide good defaults that work without configuration
  - Implement configuration validation early

### Low Risk Dependencies

#### Risk: External Library Changes
- **Dependency**: Potential changes to existing Phase 2 implementations
- **Impact**: Could require lens system adjustments
- **Mitigation**:
  - Phase 2 is stable and complete
  - Lens system designed to be isolated from Phase 2 internals
  - Integration limited to well-defined interfaces

## Parallel Development Opportunities

### Week 1: Foundation Phase
- **Sequential**: Task 3.1 (Core Lens Interface) - Must complete first
- **Parallel**: Task 3.2 can begin as soon as Task 3.1 interfaces are defined

### Week 2: Lens Implementation Phase
- **Parallel**: Tasks 3.3 (DebugLens) and 3.4 (DocumentationLens) can be developed simultaneously
- **Requirement**: Both tasks require Tasks 3.1 and 3.2 completion

### Week 3: Advanced Features Phase
- **Sequential**: Task 3.5 (Composition Engine) requires all previous tasks
- **Preparation**: Begin Task 3.6 design while Task 3.5 is being implemented

### Week 4: Integration Phase
- **Sequential**: Task 3.6 (QueryBuilder Integration) is critical path
- **Parallel**: Begin Task 3.7 individual lens implementations once integration basics work

### Week 5: Optimization Phase
- **Sequential**: Tasks 3.8 and 3.9 must be completed in order
- **Parallel**: Documentation and administrative utilities can be developed simultaneously

## Resource Allocation Recommendations

### Single Developer Scenario
Follow the critical path strictly: 3.1 → 3.2 → 3.3 → 3.4 → 3.5 → 3.6 → 3.7 → 3.8 → 3.9

### Multiple Developer Scenario
- **Week 1**: Developer A (Task 3.1), Developer B (planning Task 3.2)
- **Week 2**: Developer A (Task 3.3), Developer B (Task 3.4)
- **Week 3**: Developer A (Task 3.5), Developer B (Task 3.6 design)
- **Week 4**: Developer A (Task 3.6), Developer B (Task 3.7 individual lenses)
- **Week 5**: Developer A (Task 3.8), Developer B (Task 3.9)
