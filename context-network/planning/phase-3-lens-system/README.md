# Phase 3 Planning: Lens System

## Purpose
Planning documents for Phase 3 of CorticAI: Context Lens System implementation. This phase builds on the completed Progressive Loading System (Phase 2) to enable perspective-based context filtering and emphasis.

## Parent Context
- **Parent Planning**: [../index.md](../index.md) - Central planning navigation
- **Roadmap Context**: [../roadmap.md](../roadmap.md) - Phase 3 roadmap definition
- **Dependencies**: Phase 2 Progressive Loading System âœ… COMPLETED

## Current Status
- **Phase 2 Status**: âœ… COMPLETED (Progressive Loading with ContextDepth system)
- **Phase 3 Status**: ðŸŽ¯ NEXT PRIORITY (Ready for implementation)
- **Foundation Ready**: Progressive Loading provides depth-aware queries and entity projection

## Planning Documents in This Directory

### Core Planning
1. **[problem-definition.md](./problem-definition.md)** - What Phase 3 solves and why
2. **[requirements.md](./requirements.md)** - Functional and non-functional requirements
3. **[task-breakdown.md](./task-breakdown.md)** - Groom-ready task definitions
4. **[dependencies.md](./dependencies.md)** - Task dependency mapping
5. **[risk-assessment.md](./risk-assessment.md)** - Identified risks and mitigations
6. **[readiness-checklist.md](./readiness-checklist.md)** - Implementation readiness validation

### Architecture Design
- **[architecture-design.md](./architecture-design.md)** - Detailed system design and patterns
- **[integration-strategy.md](./integration-strategy.md)** - How lenses integrate with existing systems

## Phase 3 Overview

### Core Concept: Context Lenses
A **Context Lens** is a perspective-based filter that modifies how context is retrieved, displayed, and emphasized based on the current task or situation. Lenses enable the same underlying context to be presented differently for different purposes.

### Key Innovation
Building on Phase 2's ContextDepth system, Phase 3 adds **perspective intelligence** - automatically detecting what kind of work you're doing and adjusting context presentation accordingly.

### Success Criteria
- Switch lenses in < 100ms
- Support 10+ concurrent lenses
- Lens changes don't affect stored data
- Automatic lens detection based on activity patterns

## Dependencies Met âœ…
- **Progressive Loading System**: Provides depth-aware context loading foundation
- **Query Builder Integration**: Enables lens-based query modification
- **Entity Projection**: Allows lens-specific property filtering
- **Performance Optimization**: Depth-based optimization provides lens performance foundation

## Integration Points
- **Extends**: Progressive Loading System (Phase 2)
- **Enables**: Domain Adapters (Phase 4), Extensions (Phase 5)
- **Foundation For**: Advanced intelligence features in later phases

## Navigation
- **Up**: [../index.md](../index.md) - Planning index
- **Previous Phase**: Phase 2 Progressive Loading âœ… COMPLETED
- **Next Phase**: Phase 4 Domain Adapters (will be unblocked by this phase)
- **Implementation**: Ready for groom â†’ implement workflow

## Quick Start for Implementation
1. Review [problem-definition.md](./problem-definition.md) for context
2. Check [requirements.md](./requirements.md) for specifications
3. Use [task-breakdown.md](./task-breakdown.md) for groom-ready tasks
4. Validate [readiness-checklist.md](./readiness-checklist.md) before starting

This planning package is designed to integrate seamlessly with the `/groom` command workflow for immediate implementation readiness.
