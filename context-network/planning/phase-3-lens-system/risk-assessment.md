- **Confidence**: Established
- **Parent Context**: [dependencies.md](./dependencies.md)

## Executive Risk Summary

### Overall Risk Level: **MEDIUM**
Phase 3 builds on a solid foundation (Phase 2 âœ… Complete) with well-defined requirements, but introduces significant architectural complexity that could impact performance and user experience.

### Risk Distribution

- **Medium Risk**: 4 risks (Pattern Detection, Configuration, Memory Usage, Testing)
- **Low Risk**: 3 risks (Security, Compatibility, Deployment)

## High Risk Items

### Risk H1: Performance Impact
**Category**: Technical Performance
**Probability**: Medium (40%)
**Impact**: High
**Risk Score**: 8/10

#### Description
The lens system could introduce unacceptable performance overhead, violating the < 100ms switching and < 10% query overhead requirements.

#### Potential Consequences
- User adoption failure due to sluggish experience
- Need for architectural redesign mid-implementation
- Delayed Phase 3 completion by 2-4 weeks
- Compromised user experience affecting overall CorticAI adoption

#### Early Warning Signs
- Initial lens switching takes > 200ms in development
- Memory usage increases > 15% during early testing
- Query execution time increases > 20% with basic lenses
- Cache miss rates exceed 50% in common scenarios

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Preventive Measures:**
1. **Performance-First Design**: Design all lens components with performance as primary constraint
2. **Early Benchmarking**: Implement performance tests in Task 3.1 (Core Interface)
3. **Incremental Validation**: Test performance after each major component (Tasks 3.3, 3.5, 3.6)
4. **Prototype Critical Path**: Build performance prototype during Task 3.2 (Registry)

**Contingency Plans:**
1. **Simplified Lens Model**: Fallback to view-only lenses without query transformation
2. **Cached-First Architecture**: Pre-compute lens transformations for common queries
3. **Async Processing**: Move non-critical lens processing to background threads
4. **Feature Scope Reduction**: Remove lens composition if single lenses perform acceptably

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Lens switching consistently < 50ms in development (targeting 100ms production)
- [ ] Query overhead < 5% in development (targeting 10% production)
- [ ] Memory increase < 3% in development (targeting 5% production)
- [ ] Performance degrades linearly with lens count, not exponentially

### Risk H2: User Experience Complexity
**Category**: Product/UX
**Probability**: Medium (50%)
**Impact**: High
**Risk Score**: 8/10

#### Description
The lens system could overwhelm users with complexity, making context harder rather than easier to work with.

#### Potential Consequences
- Users disable lens system due to confusion
- Negative impact on CorticAI adoption and user satisfaction
- Support burden from user confusion
- Need for significant UX redesign post-implementation

#### Early Warning Signs
- Beta testers can't understand lens activation without extensive documentation
- Users frequently get unexpected context from automatic lens detection
- Lens composition creates confusing or contradictory results
- Users prefer manual queries over lens-assisted ones

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Preventive Measures:**
1. **Simple Defaults**: Excellent out-of-box experience with zero configuration
2. **Gradual Exposure**: Start with single lens, introduce composition later
3. **Clear Mental Models**: Ensure lens behavior is predictable and explainable
4. **User Testing**: Validate UX with real developers during Tasks 3.3-3.4

**Contingency Plans:**
1. **Simplified Interface**: Remove automatic detection, make lenses fully manual
2. **Visual Feedback**: Add clear indicators showing which lenses are active and why
3. **Lens Recommendations**: Instead of auto-activation, suggest appropriate lenses
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Hide advanced features until users request them

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] New users can benefit from lenses without reading documentation
- [ ] Lens activation reasons are obvious to users
- [ ] Users can easily turn off unwanted lens behavior
- [ ] Lens-enhanced context feels like "smart defaults" not "complex system"

### Risk H3: QueryBuilder Integration Complexity
**Category**: Technical Architecture
**Probability**: Medium (45%)
**Impact**: High
**Risk Score**: 7.5/10

#### Description
Integration with the existing QueryBuilder could be more complex than anticipated, requiring significant architecture changes or breaking backward compatibility.

#### Potential Consequences
- Delayed Phase 3 completion by 2-3 weeks
- Breaking changes to existing query functionality
- Need to refactor significant portions of Phase 2 code
- Compromise lens functionality to maintain compatibility

#### Early Warning Signs
- LensAwareQueryBuilder requires duplicating significant QueryBuilder logic
- Integration tests show performance degradation in non-lens queries
- Existing QueryBuilder tests start failing during integration
- Immutable builder pattern conflicts with lens transformation needs

#### Mitigation Strategies

**Preventive Measures:**
1. **Early Prototyping**: Build integration prototype during Task 3.2 (Registry)
2. **Incremental Integration**: Extend QueryBuilder gradually, test at each step
3. **Compatibility Testing**: Ensure all existing tests pass throughout integration
4. **Interface Isolation**: Design lens integration as optional layer, not core requirement

**Contingency Plans:**
1. **Separate Builder**: Create independent LensAwareQueryBuilder without extending existing
2. **Composition Pattern**: Use composition instead of inheritance for lens integration
3. **Minimal Integration**: Limit integration to simple lens application hooks
4. **Fallback Architecture**: Plan for lens system to work alongside existing queries

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] All existing QueryBuilder tests pass after lens integration
- [ ] Non-lens queries have zero performance impact
- [ ] Integration adds < 100 lines to existing QueryBuilder code
- [ ] Lens functionality feels natural, not bolted-on
