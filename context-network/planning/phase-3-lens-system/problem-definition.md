# Problem Definition: Phase 3 Lens System

## Classification
- **Domain**: Planning
- **Stability**: Dynamic
- **Abstraction**: Conceptual
- **Confidence**: Established
- **Phase**: 3
- **Parent Context**: [../roadmap.md](../roadmap.md)

## The Problem We're Solving

### Core Challenge: Context Overload vs Context Scarcity
With Phase 2's Progressive Loading System, we can now efficiently load context at different depth levels. However, developers face two opposing challenges:

1. **Context Overload**: Even at appropriate depths, large projects provide too much context to process effectively
2. **Context Scarcity**: The same context viewed through different perspectives (debugging vs. documentation vs. refactoring) requires different emphasis and filtering

**Result**: Developers waste time sifting through irrelevant context or miss critical context that's hidden by generic views.

### Specific Problems

#### 1. Task-Context Mismatch
- **Problem**: A developer debugging a performance issue receives the same context view as someone writing documentation
- **Impact**: Critical performance-related context is buried among general information
- **Current Workaround**: Manual filtering and searching

#### 2. Static Context Presentation
- **Problem**: Context is always presented the same way regardless of what the developer is trying to accomplish
- **Impact**: Cognitive overhead increases as developers must mentally filter context
- **Current Workaround**: Multiple separate queries or manual information organization

#### 3. Lost Context Patterns
- **Problem**: Experienced developers naturally focus on different aspects of code for different tasks, but this expertise isn't captured or shared
- **Impact**: Junior developers don't benefit from these contextual patterns
- **Current Workaround**: Mentoring and code review, which doesn't scale

#### 4. Context Switching Inefficiency
- **Problem**: When switching between tasks (coding → debugging → documentation), developers must mentally reconstruct different views of the same codebase
- **Impact**: Time lost on context switching and potential for missing important connections
- **Current Workaround**: Keeping multiple IDE windows or manual note-taking

## Why This Matters Now

### Foundation Ready
Phase 2's Progressive Loading System provides the necessary infrastructure:
- **ContextDepth**: Enables depth-based loading
- **Entity Projection**: Allows property-level filtering
- **Query Builder Integration**: Supports query modification
- **Performance Optimization**: Provides fast context switching foundation

### High-Value Use Cases Enabled
1. **Debugging Lens**: Emphasizes error paths, performance bottlenecks, and related issues
2. **Documentation Lens**: Highlights public APIs, examples, and user-facing functionality
3. **Refactoring Lens**: Shows dependencies, usage patterns, and impact zones
4. **Security Lens**: Emphasizes data flows, authentication, and vulnerability patterns

### Scalability Foundation
As CorticAI grows to handle larger codebases, intelligent context filtering becomes essential rather than nice-to-have.

## Success Definition

### Primary Success Criteria
1. **Automatic Lens Detection**: System automatically detects current developer task and activates appropriate lens
2. **Sub-100ms Lens Switching**: Near-instantaneous perspective changes
3. **Context Relevance**: 80%+ of displayed context is relevant to current task (measured by developer interaction patterns)
4. **Lens Composition**: Multiple lenses can be combined for complex scenarios

### Business Value Metrics
1. **Reduced Time-to-Context**: 50% reduction in time to find relevant context for a given task
2. **Improved Context Accuracy**: 70% reduction in irrelevant context displayed
3. **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Intuitive context that adapts to developer needs
4. **Knowledge Transfer**: Capture and share contextual expertise through lens patterns

## Stakeholders

### Primary Users
- **Active Developers**: Benefit from task-appropriate context presentation
- **Code Reviewers**: Get focused views for review activities
- **Documentation Writers**: See API-focused context views
- **System Architects**: View dependency and structure-focused context

### Secondary Beneficiaries
- **Team Leads**: Understand team context usage patterns
- **New Team Members**: Benefit from expert-defined context lenses
- **DevOps Engineers**: Get deployment and configuration-focused views

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must build on Progressive Loading System (Phase 2) ✅
- Lens switching must be < 100ms (user experience requirement)
- Cannot modify stored data (lenses are view-only)
- Must integrate with existing Query Builder architecture

### Business Constraints
- Implementation must not break existing functionality
- Lens definitions should be sharable across teams
- System must work without lens configuration (graceful degradation)

### Assumptions to Validate
1. **Developer task patterns are detectable** through code interaction patterns
2. **Context preferences are consistent** within task types across developers
3. **Lens switching overhead is acceptable** compared to context relevance benefits
4. **Lens composition complexity** won't overwhelm users

## Out of Scope for Phase 3
- Machine learning-based lens recommendations (Phase 5+)
- Real-time collaborative lens sharing (Phase 5+)
- Complex lens composition UI (focus on API foundation)
- Cross-project lens standardization (Phase 4+)

## Validation Strategy
1. **Technical Proof**: Build basic lens system with 3-4 lens types
2. **Performance Validation**: Measure lens switching times and context loading impact
3. **User Value Validation**: A/B test context relevance with/without lenses
4. **Integration Validation**: Confirm seamless integration with Progressive Loading

## Dependencies on Other Systems
- **Phase 2 Progressive Loading**: ✅ COMPLETED - provides foundation
- **Query Builder**: Existing system must support lens-based modification
- **Entity Storage**: Must support lens-based property filtering
- **Performance Monitor**: Will track lens switching performance

## Related Problems (Future Phases)
- **Domain-Specific Lenses** (Phase 4): Specialized lenses for different domains
- **AI-Powered Lens Recommendations** (Phase 5): Intelligent lens suggestions
- **Team Lens Sharing** (Phase 5): Collaborative lens development and sharing

This problem definition establishes Phase 3 as the critical bridge between efficient context loading (Phase 2) and intelligent context presentation for real-world development scenarios.
