# Continuity Cortex Planning Overview

## Purpose
Planning documentation for the Continuity Cortex feature - an intelligent file operation interceptor that prevents duplicate creation and detects amnesia loops in AI agent workflows.

## Status
- **Phase**: Planning & Architecture
- **Start Date**: 2025-09-19
- **Planning Session**: In Progress
- **Implementation Status**: Not Started

## Planning Artifacts

### Core Documentation
- [problem-definition.md](./problem-definition.md) - What we're solving and why
- [requirements.md](./requirements.md) - Functional and non-functional requirements
- [task-breakdown.md](./task-breakdown.md) - Implementation tasks with estimates
- [dependencies.md](./dependencies.md) - Dependencies and prerequisite work
- [risk-assessment.md](./risk-assessment.md) - Identified risks and mitigations
- [readiness-checklist.md](./readiness-checklist.md) - Implementation readiness validation

### Architecture
- [../architecture/continuity-cortex/](../architecture/continuity-cortex/) - Technical design and patterns
- [../research/continuity-cortex/](../research/continuity-cortex/) - Research findings and alternatives

## Success Criteria

This planning session will be complete when:

1. **Problem clearly defined** with stakeholders and success metrics
2. **Requirements documented** with clear acceptance criteria
3. **Architecture designed** with component interactions and patterns
4. **Tasks broken down** into implementable, testable units
5. **Dependencies mapped** with clear prerequisites
6. **Risks assessed** with mitigation strategies
7. **Implementation readiness** validated through checklist

## Context

The Continuity Cortex is Phase 2 of the Universal Context Engine vision. It represents the intelligence layer that prevents "amnesia loops" - the pattern where AI agents repeatedly create duplicate files because they can't recognize existing ones.

### Foundation Ready
Phase 1 is complete with:
- ✅ KuzuStorageAdapter (graph database operations)
- ✅ ContextInitializer (.context directory structure)
- ✅ Performance monitoring system
- ✅ All 759 tests passing

### Strategic Importance
This feature demonstrates the core value proposition of the Universal Context Engine:
- Intelligent deduplication beyond simple file matching
- Pattern recognition across different file formats and naming conventions
- Learning from user behavior to improve recommendations
- Seamless integration with existing agent workflows

## Planning Approach

Following the systematic planning process:
1. **Problem Understanding** - Deep dive into duplication patterns and user pain points
2. **Research & Discovery** - Evaluate similarity detection algorithms and frameworks
3. **Architecture Design** - Design component interactions and integration patterns
4. **Task Decomposition** - Break into implementable, testable units
5. **Risk Assessment** - Identify technical and user experience risks
6. **Implementation Readiness** - Validate prerequisites and team readiness

## Stakeholders

### Primary Users
- AI agents using the context system
- Developers working on agent workflows
- System operators monitoring context quality

### Technical Dependencies
- Mastra framework (agent integration)
- KuzuStorageAdapter (relationship tracking)
- File system interception mechanisms
- Similarity detection algorithms

## Next Steps

1. Complete problem definition with specific examples
2. Research existing similarity detection approaches
3. Design agent integration patterns
4. Create detailed task breakdown
5. Validate implementation readiness
