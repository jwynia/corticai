# Continuity Cortex: Problem Definition

## Problem Statement

**AI agents and developers repeatedly create duplicate artifacts because they lack the intelligence to recognize when existing files already serve the same purpose.**

This isn't simply about identical files - it's about files that are conceptually equivalent but differ in:
- File names (`todo.md` vs `tasks.md` vs `current_work.md`)
- File formats (Markdown vs plain text vs YAML)
- Content structure (different organizing principles for the same information)
- File locations (scattered across different directories)

## The "Amnesia Loop" Pattern

### Definition
An amnesia loop occurs when an AI agent or developer:
1. Needs to create or update a file for a specific purpose
2. Cannot locate existing files that serve the same purpose
3. Creates a new file instead of using/updating the existing one
4. Results in multiple files with overlapping or duplicate information
5. System complexity increases while information quality decreases

### Real Examples from the Project

**Documentation Duplication:**
```
context-network/
├── planning/groomed-backlog.md
├── planning/unified_backlog.md
├── planning/backlog.md
├── planning/phase-1-tasks.md
└── planning/implementation_phases.md
```
All contain overlapping task information with different organizing principles.

**Configuration Scattered:**
```
app/
├── vitest.config.ts
├── package.json (scripts)
└── context-network/planning/context-engine-alignment.md (config decisions)
```
Configuration decisions spread across multiple files and formats.

**Research Fragmentation:**
```
context-network/research/
├── problem_validation/deduplication_strategies.md
├── findings/dependency-validation.md
└── universal_patterns/domain_adapter_framework.md
```
Related research scattered without cross-references or consolidation.

## Impact Analysis

### For AI Agents
- **Context Pollution**: Multiple files with similar content degrade context quality
- **Decision Paralysis**: Agents can't determine which file is "authoritative"
- **Wasted Computation**: Time spent creating duplicates instead of improving existing content
- **Inconsistent State**: Changes to one file don't propagate to conceptually similar files

### For Developers
- **Cognitive Load**: Must remember which file contains what information
- **Maintenance Burden**: Updates must be applied to multiple locations
- **Information Silos**: Related information becomes fragmented and hard to find
- **Project Entropy**: System becomes increasingly disorganized over time

### For System Quality
- **Information Decay**: Outdated duplicates contain stale information
- **Source of Truth Problems**: No clear authority for any given topic
- **Search Inefficiency**: Relevant information harder to locate
- **Onboarding Friction**: New team members confused by duplicate resources

## Stakeholder Analysis

### Primary Stakeholders

**AI Agents**
- **Need**: Intelligent file operation guidance
- **Pain Point**: Cannot distinguish between conceptually similar files
- **Success Metric**: Reduction in duplicate file creation
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Agents consistently choose to update existing files over creating new ones

**Developers**
- **Need**: Organized, non-redundant project structure
- **Pain Point**: Manual effort to maintain file organization
- **Success Metric**: Decreased time spent on file management
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Clear recommendations for file actions (create/update/merge)

**Project Maintainers**
- **Need**: System that maintains quality over time
- **Pain Point**: Project entropy and information fragmentation
- **Success Metric**: Stable or improving information organization
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Automated detection and prevention of organization decay

### Secondary Stakeholders

**New Team Members**
- **Need**: Clear information hierarchy
- **Benefit**: Easier onboarding with less confusion
- **Impact**: Faster productivity ramp-up

**System Operators**
- **Need**: Monitoring and maintenance tools
- **Benefit**: Visibility into system health and organization quality
- **Impact**: Proactive identification of organizational issues

## Success Criteria

### Immediate Success (1-2 weeks)
- **Prevent First Duplicate**: System successfully prevents creation of obviously duplicate file
- **Provide Intelligent Suggestions**: Agent receives actionable recommendations (update vs create)
- **Zero False Positives**: No incorrect blocking of legitimate new files
- **Seamless Integration**: Works within existing Mastra agent workflows

### Short-term Success (1-2 months)
- **Pattern Learning**: System improves recommendations based on user decisions
- **Multi-format Detection**: Recognizes similarity across different file formats
- **Context Awareness**: Considers project structure and naming conventions
- **User Adoption**: Developers actively use recommendations

### Long-term Success (3-6 months)
- **Amnesia Loop Elimination**: Dramatic reduction in conceptually duplicate files
- **Proactive Organization**: System suggests reorganization and consolidation
- **Cross-project Patterns**: Learns organizational patterns applicable to multiple projects
- **Quality Metrics**: Measurable improvement in information organization

## Scope Definition

### In Scope
- File operation interception (create, write, move)
- Multi-layer similarity detection (name, structure, content, purpose)
- Real-time recommendation engine
- Integration with Mastra agent framework
- Pattern learning from user decisions
- Amnesia loop detection and prevention

### Out of Scope (for initial implementation)
- Automatic file merging without user consent
- Cross-repository duplication detection
- Version control integration
- Real-time collaboration features
- Advanced ML/AI similarity models (start with rule-based)
- Performance optimization (focus on correctness first)

### Boundary Conditions
- **File Size Limit**: Initially focus on text files under 1MB
- **File Type Scope**: Text-based files (md, txt, yaml, json, ts, js)
- **Performance Constraint**: Analysis must complete within 100ms for real-time use
- **Accuracy Threshold**: 95% accuracy in duplicate detection (measured against manual review)

## Business Value

### Quantifiable Benefits
- **Reduced File Count**: 20-30% reduction in conceptually duplicate files
- **Improved Search Efficiency**: Faster information discovery
- **Decreased Maintenance Time**: Less time spent on manual organization
- **Higher Information Quality**: More accurate and up-to-date content

### Strategic Benefits
- **AI Agent Intelligence**: Demonstrates learning and contextual awareness
- **System Scalability**: Maintains organization quality as project grows
- **Knowledge Management**: Establishes foundation for advanced knowledge systems
- **Competitive Advantage**: Novel approach to information organization

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must integrate with existing Mastra framework patterns
- Cannot significantly impact file operation performance
- Must work with current storage infrastructure (Kuzu + DuckDB)
- Should leverage existing graph database capabilities

### Business Constraints
- Implementation must be incremental (no big-bang deployment)
- Must not disrupt existing workflows
- Should require minimal configuration or setup
- Must provide clear value from first use

### Assumptions to Validate
- Users will accept intelligent file operation recommendations
- File similarity can be detected reliably with rule-based approaches
- Graph database can efficiently store and query file relationships
- Performance overhead is acceptable for the value provided

## Risk Assessment Preview

### High-Risk Areas
- **False Positives**: Incorrectly blocking legitimate new files
- **Performance Impact**: Slowing down file operations
- **User Acceptance**: Developers may ignore or disable recommendations
- **Complexity Creep**: Feature becomes overly complex or hard to maintain

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with conservative similarity thresholds
- Implement comprehensive performance monitoring
- Provide clear opt-out mechanisms
- Follow incremental development with user feedback loops
