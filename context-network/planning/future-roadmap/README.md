# Future Development Roadmap - Beyond Current Sprint

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the strategic development path for CorticAI beyond the currently groomed tasks. The vision is to evolve from a working prototype with proven universal patterns into a production-ready intelligent context engine that can revolutionize how we work with file-based knowledge.

## Current State (as of September 2025)

### Completed
- ✅ Universal pattern theory validated
- ✅ TypeScript Dependency Analyzer (production-ready)
- ✅ AttributeIndex with boolean queries
- ✅ Universal Fallback Adapter
- ✅ 104 tests passing, solid foundation

### In Progress (Current Sprint)
- Novel domain adapter implementation
- Cross-domain pattern validation
- Technical debt cleanup (file size, test isolation)

## Strategic Phases

### Phase 1: Cross-Domain Validation (Q4 2025)
**Goal**: Prove universal patterns work across multiple domains

### Phase 2: Intelligence Layer (Q1 2026)
**Goal**: Add semantic understanding and learning capabilities

### Phase 3: Scale & Performance (Q2 2026)
**Goal**: Handle enterprise-scale codebases and knowledge repositories

### Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration (Q3 2026)
**Goal**: Become the universal context layer for development tools

### Phase 5: Autonomous Intelligence (Q4 2026)
**Goal**: Self-maintaining, self-optimizing context engine

## Key Innovation Areas

1. **Hybrid Intelligence**: Combining pattern-based and neural approaches
2. **Temporal Context**: Understanding how knowledge evolves over time
3. **Causal Reasoning**: Moving beyond correlation to causation
4. **Multi-Modal Understanding**: Code, docs, diagrams, and beyond
5. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Team-wide context sharing

## Success Metrics

- Performance: Sub-second queries on 1M+ entities
- Accuracy: 95%+ entity extraction precision
- Adoption: Integration with major development tools
- Impact: 50% reduction in context-switching overhead
