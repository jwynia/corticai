## Dependency Risks

### High-Risk Dependencies

1. **Graph Database Selection** (T1.1)
   - Risk: Wrong choice could require complete rewrite
   - Mitigation: Extensive evaluation, abstraction layer

2. **ML Model Quality** (T2.1)
   - Risk: Poor embeddings affect all downstream features
   - Mitigation: Multiple model options, quality metrics

3. **Distributed Architecture** (T3.1)
   - Risk: Complexity explosion
   - Mitigation: Incremental migration, fallback options

### External Dependencies

| Dependency | Risk Level | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|--------|------------|
| OpenAI API | Medium | T2.1, T5.3 | Local model fallback |
| GitHub API | Low | T4.2 | Caching, rate limiting |
| Cloud Provider | Medium | T3.* | Multi-cloud strategy |
| npm Registry | Low | All | Private registry mirror |

## Sequencing Strategy

### Minimum Viable Sequence
1. Graph database integration (enables scale)
2. One additional adapter (proves universality)
3. Basic intelligence features (adds value)
4. API layer (enables integration)

### Optimal Sequence
Following the critical path while maximizing parallel work:
- Week 1-4: Database + Adapters in parallel
- Week 5-8: Storage layer + Early intelligence
- Week 9-12: Core intelligence + Distribution prep
- Week 13-16: Scale + Integration
- Week 17-20: Advanced features + Polish

### Risk-Mitigated Sequence
Addressing highest risks first:
1. Graph database POC (Risk: Performance)
2. Cross-domain validation (Risk: Pattern transfer)
3. Security implementation (Risk: Multi-tenant)
4. Distribution architecture (Risk: Complexity)
