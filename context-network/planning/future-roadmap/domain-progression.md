# Domain Progression Strategy

## Domain Expansion Philosophy

Start with domains that have clear structure, then progress to increasingly ambiguous domains. Each domain teaches lessons that apply to the next.

## Domain Learning Sequence

```
Code → Documents → Schemas → Contracts → Creative → Multimedia
  ↓        ↓          ↓          ↓           ↓          ↓
Clear   Semi-      Formal    Rule-based  Ambiguous  Complex
AST    structured  Syntax     Natural    Narrative  Modality
```

## Phase 1: Structured Code Domains

### Why Start Here
- Clear syntax and grammar
- Established parsing tools (ASTs)
- Explicit relationships (imports, inheritance)
- Immediate value to developers

### Progression Within Code
```
1. TypeScript   - Strongly typed, explicit
2. Python       - Dynamic, but clear structure  
3. JavaScript   - Loose, requires inference
4. SQL          - Declarative, different paradigm
5. Shell/Bash   - Procedural, context-dependent
```

### Lessons Each Teaches
- **TypeScript**: Type relationships, explicit contracts
- **Python**: Dynamic patterns, convention over configuration
- **JavaScript**: Ambiguity resolution, context importance
- **SQL**: Data relationships, set operations
- **Shell**: Command composition, environment context

## Phase 2: Semi-Structured Documents

### Why This Second
- Builds on text processing from code
- Has some structure (headings, lists)
- Human-readable but parseable
- Bridge between code and natural language

### Document Type Progression
```
1. Markdown     - Clear structure markers
2. README       - Conventional sections
3. API Docs     - Technical but narrative
4. Confluence   - Mixed content types
5. Emails       - Conversation threads
```

### New Patterns to Learn
- Hierarchical document structure
- Cross-references and links
- Mixed content (code + narrative)
- Implied relationships
- Temporal sequences (in emails)

## Phase 3: Schema and Configuration

### Why This Third
- Formal structure like code
- But represents concepts, not behavior
- Teaches data modeling patterns
- Critical for system understanding

### Schema Progression
```
1. JSON Schema  - Simple, hierarchical
2. GraphQL      - Types and relationships
3. OpenAPI      - Operations and contracts
4. Protobuf     - Binary efficiency needs
5. Database DDL - Physical data modeling
```

### Unique Lessons
- Data shape vs behavior
- Contract definition
- Validation rules
- Evolution and versioning
- Performance implications

## Phase 4: Business Documents

### Why This Fourth
- Mix of structure and narrative
- Domain-specific patterns
- Legal/business precision required
- Real-world complexity

### Business Document Progression
```
1. Requirements - Technical but prose
2. Contracts    - Legal precision
3. Invoices     - Structured data
4. Reports      - Analysis and narrative
5. Proposals    - Persuasive structure
```

### Advanced Patterns
- Legal clause relationships
- Monetary calculations
- Timeline dependencies
- Stakeholder networks
- Compliance requirements

## Phase 5: Creative Content

### Why This Fifth
- Maximum ambiguity
- Subjective interpretation
- Emotional and aesthetic dimensions
- Tests limits of pattern recognition

### Creative Progression
```
1. Blog Posts   - Informal but structured
2. Fiction      - Narrative structure
3. Poetry       - Minimal structure
4. Scripts      - Dialog and action
5. Music Sheets - Non-textual patterns
```

### Edge Cases to Handle
- Metaphor and symbolism
- Non-linear narratives
- Implied meaning
- Cultural context
- Artistic intent

## Phase 6: Multimedia Integration

### Why This Last
- Requires all previous learning
- Multiple modalities
- Complex correlation needs
- Cutting-edge technically

### Multimedia Progression
```
1. Diagrams     - Visual structure
2. Screenshots  - UI understanding
3. Videos       - Temporal visual
4. Audio        - Speech and sound
5. Mixed Media  - Everything combined
```

### Ultimate Challenges
- Cross-modal correlation
- Temporal synchronization
- Quality variations
- Format conversions
- Real-time processing

## Pattern Transfer Strategy

### Vertical Transfer (Within Domain Family)
```
TypeScript → JavaScript → CoffeeScript
    ↓            ↓              ↓
  Types      Patterns        Syntax
  
Learning from one helps with others in same family
```

### Horizontal Transfer (Across Domains)
```
Code Imports → Document Links → Schema References
      ↓              ↓                ↓
          Dependency Pattern (Universal)
```

### Abstract Pattern Extraction
Each domain contributes to universal patterns:
- **Hierarchy**: From code classes and document headings
- **Dependency**: From imports and references
- **Composition**: From functions and sections
- **Inheritance**: From classes and templates
- **Versioning**: From git and document revisions

## Domain-Specific Adapters

### Adapter Complexity Progression

#### Level 1: Regex-Based
```typescript
// Simple pattern matching
const functionPattern = /function\s+(\w+)/g
```

#### Level 2: Grammar-Based
```typescript
// Formal grammar parsing
const grammar = new Grammar(rules)
const ast = grammar.parse(input)
```

#### Level 3: AST-Based
```typescript
// Full syntax tree analysis
const ast = parser.parse(code)
traverse(ast, visitors)
```

#### Level 4: Semantic
```typescript
// Understanding meaning
const entities = extractSemanticEntities(ast, context)
```

#### Level 5: Learned
```typescript
// ML-based extraction
const model = await train(examples)
const entities = model.extract(input)
```

## Long-Term Domain Vision

### Ultimate Goal
Create a system that can understand and correlate information across any domain, learning new domains automatically through pattern transfer and few-shot learning.

### Future Domains
- Medical records
- Scientific papers
- Legal documents
- Financial reports
- Manufacturing specs
- Educational content

### Domain-Agnostic Future
Eventually, the system shouldn't need explicit domain adapters but should recognize and adapt to new domains automatically through:
- Pattern recognition
- Transfer learning
- Few-shot adaptation
- Continuous learning
