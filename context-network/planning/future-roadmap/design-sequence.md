# Design & Sequencing Strategy

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
Start with minimal viable architecture, then layer on capabilities without breaking existing functionality.

### 2. Abstraction-First
Every major component gets an abstraction layer before implementation, enabling future swaps without cascading changes.

### 3. Learn-Then-Build
Validate patterns and assumptions with small experiments before committing to large architectural changes.

## Architectural Evolution Sequence

### Foundation Layer (Must Complete First)

#### Storage Abstraction
**Why First**: Everything depends on data persistence
```typescript
interface Storage {
  // Start with simple key-value
  get(key: string): Promise<any>
  set(key: string, value: any): Promise<void>
  
  // Then add querying
  query(pattern: QueryPattern): AsyncIterator<Result>
  
  // Finally add transactions
  transaction(): Transaction
}
```
**Sequence**: JSON adapter → Graph adapter → Hybrid storage

#### Entity Model Standardization
**Why Early**: Defines the language all components speak
```typescript
interface Entity {
  id: EntityId           // Unique identifier
  type: EntityType       // What kind of thing
  attributes: Map        // Key-value properties
  relationships: Set     // Connections to others
  confidence: Score      // How sure we are
  source: Source         // Where it came from
}
```
**Sequence**: Basic fields → Confidence scoring → Provenance tracking

### Intelligence Layer (Builds on Foundation)

#### Pattern Recognition Pipeline
**Design Sequence**:
1. **Observable Patterns**: Simple counting and frequency
2. **Statistical Patterns**: Correlation and clustering  
3. **Learned Patterns**: ML-based discovery
4. **Transferable Patterns**: Cross-domain application

```typescript
// Evolution of pattern detection
v1: CountingPatternDetector    // "X appears N times"
v2: StatisticalDetector        // "X correlates with Y"
v3: NeuralPatternDetector      // "This looks like pattern Z"
v4: UniversalPatternEngine     // "Pattern from domain A applies to B"
```

#### Semantic Understanding Evolution
**Why This Order**: Each level enables the next
1. **Lexical**: Exact string matching
2. **Syntactic**: Structure-aware matching
3. **Semantic**: Meaning-based matching
4. **Contextual**: Situation-aware understanding

### Scale Architecture (After Core Proven)

#### Processing Pipeline Evolution
```
Single-threaded → Multi-threaded → Multi-process → Distributed
     ↓                ↓                ↓              ↓
   Simple          Worker           Queue          Stream
   Loop            Pool            Based         Processing
```

**Key Design Decision**: Start with simplest model that works, only add complexity when limits are hit.

#### Query Optimization Sequence
1. **Brute Force**: Scan everything (works for < 1K entities)
2. **Indexed**: Pre-computed indices (works for < 100K)
3. **Cached**: Memory-resident hot data (works for < 1M)
4. **Distributed**: Sharded across nodes (unlimited scale)

## Component Design Sequence

### Adapter Framework Evolution

#### Stage 1: Hard-Coded Adapters
```typescript
class TypeScriptAdapter {
  extract(file: string): Entity[] {
    // Direct implementation
  }
}
```

#### Stage 2: Configuration-Driven
```typescript
class ConfigurableAdapter {
  constructor(config: AdapterConfig) {
    // Patterns defined in config
  }
}
```

#### Stage 3: Learning Adapters
```typescript
class LearningAdapter {
  observe(file: string, corrections: Entity[]) {
    // Learn from user feedback
  }
}
```

#### Stage 4: Universal Adapter
```typescript
class UniversalAdapter {
  adapt(domain: Domain): DomainAdapter {
    // Generate domain-specific adapter
  }
}
```

### Intelligence Services Design

#### Layered Intelligence Architecture
```
Layer 4: Reasoning     (Why? Causation, prediction)
        ↑
Layer 3: Understanding (What does it mean? Semantics)
        ↑
Layer 2: Recognition   (What is it? Classification)
        ↑
Layer 1: Detection     (Is something there? Extraction)
```

**Sequencing Rule**: Can't build Layer N+1 until Layer N is stable.

### Multi-Modal Processing Design

#### Modality Integration Sequence
1. **Text-Only**: Current state
2. **Text + Structure**: Add AST, schemas, configs
3. **Text + Visual**: Add diagrams, screenshots
4. **Full Multi-Modal**: Any input type

**Design Pattern**: Each modality has its own processor, unified at entity level:
```typescript
interface ModalityProcessor<T> {
  canProcess(input: unknown): input is T
  extract(input: T): Entity[]
  confidence(input: T): number
}
```

## System Design Decisions & Sequencing

### Decision 1: Storage Technology
**Sequence of Evaluation**:
1. Benchmark with synthetic data
2. Prototype with real data subset
3. Implement abstraction layer
4. Parallel run both systems
5. Gradual migration
6. Deprecate old system

### Decision 2: ML Integration
**Progressive Enhancement**:
```
Rule-based → Statistical → Classical ML → Deep Learning
    ↓            ↓              ↓              ↓
  Fast,        Better,       Adaptive,     State-of-art,
  Simple      No training    Trainable      Complex
```

### Decision 3: Distribution Strategy
**Incremental Distribution**:
1. **Monolith**: Everything in one process
2. **Modular Monolith**: Separate modules, same process
3. **Service-Oriented**: Separate processes, same machine
4. **Distributed**: Multiple machines, orchestrated

### Decision 4: API Evolution
**Interface Progression**:
```
CLI only → Local API → REST API → GraphQL → Event Streams
   ↓          ↓           ↓          ↓           ↓
Testing   Automation   Integration  Flexible   Real-time
```

## Work Stream Sequencing

### Stream A: Core Platform
```
Storage Abstraction
    ↓
Entity Model
    ↓
Query Engine
    ↓
Performance Layer
```

### Stream B: Intelligence
```
Pattern Detection
    ↓
Entity Resolution
    ↓
Semantic Analysis

Causal Reasoning
```

### Stream C: Adapters
```
Code Adapters (TS, Python, Go)
    ↓
Document Adapters (Markdown, Docs)
    ↓
Schema Adapters (SQL, GraphQL, OpenAPI)
    ↓
Visual Adapters (Diagrams, Screenshots)
```

### Stream D: User Experience
```
CLI Enhancement
    ↓
Configuration Management
    ↓
IDE Integration
    ↓
Web Interface
```

## Sequencing Rules

### Rule 1: Foundation Before Features
Never add features that compromise the foundation. Storage, entity model, and query engine must be rock-solid.

### Rule 2: Narrow Before Wide
Prove each capability deeply in one domain before expanding to others.

### Rule 3: Simple Before Smart
Get basic extraction working before adding intelligence. Pattern matching before ML.

### Rule 4: Local Before Distributed
Prove everything works in a single process before distributing.

### Rule 5: Observe Before Optimize
Measure actual bottlenecks before optimizing. Many "obvious" optimizations are wrong.

## Architecture Decision Points

### Fork in the Road: Graph vs Relational
**Decision Sequence**:
1. Model relationships in both paradigms
2. Benchmark query patterns
3. Evaluate flexibility needs
4. Consider operational complexity
5. Make decision based on evidence

### Fork in the Road: Embedded vs Service ML
**Decision Sequence**:
1. Prototype with embedded models
2. Measure resource usage
3. Evaluate latency requirements
4. Consider privacy needs
5. Design hybrid approach if needed

### Fork in the Road: Sync vs Async Processing
**Decision Sequence**:
1. Start with synchronous (simpler)
2. Identify blocking operations
3. Make those async
4. Add queue for long operations
5. Full async/streaming if needed

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Anti-Pattern 1: Premature Distribution
**Wrong**: Distribute from day one
**Right**: Distribute when single machine hits limits

### Anti-Pattern 2: Over-Engineering
**Wrong**: Build for 1M users on day one
**Right**: Build for next order of magnitude

### Anti-Pattern 3: Feature Creep
**Wrong**: Add every requested feature
**Right**: Core features work perfectly

### Anti-Pattern 4: Technology Tourism
**Wrong**: Use every new technology
**Right**: Boring technology, exciting product
