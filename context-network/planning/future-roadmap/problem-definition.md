# Problem Definition: Next-Generation Context Intelligence

## The Meta Problem

As CorticAI evolves beyond basic entity extraction and indexing, we face increasingly complex challenges in understanding and maintaining context across diverse knowledge domains.

## Core Problems to Solve

### 1. Semantic Ambiguity Resolution
**Problem**: The same term means different things in different contexts
- "Component" in React vs mechanical engineering vs music
- "Service" in microservices vs customer service vs military
- "Pipeline" in CI/CD vs data processing vs oil industry

**Impact**: 
- False positive connections between unrelated entities
- Confusion when switching between domains
- Incorrect pattern transfer across contexts

**Success Criteria**:
- 95%+ accuracy in entity disambiguation
- Context-aware entity resolution
- Semantic distance metrics between entities

### 2. Temporal Context Evolution
**Problem**: Knowledge and relationships change over time
- Code refactoring changes dependency relationships
- Documentation becomes outdated
- Team knowledge evolves with experience

**Impact**:
- Stale context leads to wrong decisions
- Historical context lost during updates
- No way to understand evolution patterns

**Success Criteria**:
- Version-aware context tracking
- Historical relationship preservation
- Evolution pattern detection

### 3. Scale and Performance
**Problem**: Current JSON-based storage won't scale
- Linear search complexity for complex queries
- Memory limitations with large datasets
- No support for distributed queries

**Impact**:
- Performance degrades with project size
- Memory exhaustion on large codebases
- Cannot handle enterprise-scale repositories

**Success Criteria**:
- Sub-second queries on 1M+ entities
- Streaming processing for large files
- Distributed query capability

### 4. Multi-Modal Context Understanding
**Problem**: Modern projects contain more than just code
- Architecture diagrams
- API specifications
- Database schemas
- UI mockups
- Meeting notes

**Impact**:
- Incomplete context missing visual/structural information
- Manual correlation between different artifact types
- Lost connections between design and implementation

**Success Criteria**:
- Extract entities from 10+ file types
- Cross-reference between modalities
- Unified context graph across all artifacts

### 5. Team Knowledge Coordination
**Problem**: Individual context doesn't scale to teams
- Each developer has partial knowledge
- Context fragments across team members
- No way to share learned patterns

**Impact**:
- Repeated discovery of same patterns
- Inconsistent understanding across team
- Knowledge silos and bottlenecks

**Success Criteria**:
- Shared context repository
- Conflict resolution for contradictory patterns
- Team-wide pattern learning

### 6. Intelligent Maintenance
**Problem**: Context degrades without active maintenance
- Broken references accumulate
- Obsolete patterns persist
- Performance degrades over time

**Impact**:
- Technical debt in context layer
- Increasing query times
- Decreasing accuracy

**Success Criteria**:
- Self-healing reference resolution
- Automatic obsolescence detection
- Performance self-optimization

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why These Problems Exist

1. **Complexity Growth**: As systems grow, context becomes exponentially complex
2. **Domain Diversity**: Universal patterns must handle infinite variations
3. **Dynamic Nature**: Knowledge constantly evolves
4. **Human Limitations**: Manual maintenance doesn't scale
5. **Tool Fragmentation**: Each tool has its own context model

## Problem Prioritization Matrix

| Problem | Impact | Urgency | Complexity | Priority |
|---------|--------|---------|------------|----------|
| Scale & Performance | High | High | Medium | P0 |
| Semantic Ambiguity | High | Medium | High | P1 |
| Multi-Modal Context | Medium | Low | High | P2 |
| Temporal Evolution | Medium | Medium | Medium | P2 |
| Team Coordination | High | Low | Medium | P3 |
| Intelligent Maintenance | Medium | Low | High | P3 |

## Stakeholder Impact

### Developers
- **Current Pain**: Context switching overhead
- **Future Benefit**: Instant context availability

### Teams
- **Current Pain**: Knowledge fragmentation
- **Future Benefit**: Shared understanding

### Organizations
- **Current Pain**: Onboarding complexity
- **Future Benefit**: Accelerated productivity

## Constraints and Boundaries

### What We Will Solve
- Automated context extraction and maintenance
- Cross-domain pattern recognition
- Intelligent relationship inference
- Performance at scale

### What We Won't Solve
- Source code generation
- Automated refactoring
- Business logic decisions
- Human judgment replacement

## Success Vision

When these problems are solved, CorticAI will:
1. Understand any codebase in seconds, not hours
2. Maintain perfect context across all artifacts
3. Learn and apply patterns automatically
4. Scale to any size project
5. Coordinate team knowledge seamlessly
6. Self-maintain and optimize continuously

## Next Steps

With these problems clearly defined, we can now:
1. Design architecture to address each problem
2. Break down into implementable tasks
3. Identify required research and experimentation
4. Plan incremental delivery strategy
