# DuckDB Storage Adapter Planning

## Overview

This directory contains the comprehensive planning documentation for implementing a DuckDB storage adapter that integrates with the existing storage abstraction layer.

## Purpose

DuckDB was selected in ADR-003 as the analytics database for the CorticAI project, complementing Kuzu for graph operations. This adapter will provide:
- Columnar storage optimized for analytics
- Fast aggregations and queries
- Parquet file support
- SQL interface for complex queries
- Embedded database with no server requirements

## Planning Documents

1. **[problem-definition.md](./problem-definition.md)** - What we're solving and why
2. **[requirements.md](./requirements.md)** - Functional and non-functional requirements
3. **[architecture-design.md](./architecture-design.md)** - Technical design and integration
4. **[task-breakdown.md](./task-breakdown.md)** - Detailed implementation tasks
5. **[dependencies.md](./dependencies.md)** - Task dependencies and sequencing
6. **[risk-assessment.md](./risk-assessment.md)** - Potential issues and mitigations
7. **[readiness-checklist.md](./readiness-checklist.md)** - Pre-implementation verification

## Key Decisions

- Use `@duckdb/node-api` package for TypeScript support
- Extend BaseStorageAdapter for consistency
- Support both key-value and columnar query patterns
- Enable Parquet import/export capabilities
- Provide transaction support for complex operations

## Success Criteria

The planning is complete when:
1. All requirements are documented and validated
2. Architecture integrates cleanly with existing system
3. Tasks are broken down to implementable units
4. Risks are identified with mitigation strategies
5. Team can start implementation without ambiguity

## Status

**Current Phase**: Planning & Architecture
**Next Step**: Complete all planning documents before implementation
