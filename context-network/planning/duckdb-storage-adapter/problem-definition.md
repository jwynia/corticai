# Problem Definition: DuckDB Storage Adapter

## What We're Solving

### Primary Problem
The current storage abstraction supports JSON and in-memory storage, but lacks a solution optimized for analytical queries and large-scale data operations. While these adapters work well for simple key-value storage, they cannot efficiently handle:
- Aggregations across millions of entities
- Complex analytical queries
- Time-series analysis
- Statistical computations
- Large dataset processing

### Why This Matters

1. **Performance at Scale**: As the context network grows, querying patterns will become more complex. AttributeIndex queries that work fine with thousands of entities will struggle with millions.

2. **Analytics Requirements**: Per ADR-003, we need to support:
   - Fast aggregations for dashboard views
   - Materialized views for common access patterns
   - Full-text search capabilities
   - Statistical analysis of entity relationships

3. **Data Science Integration**: DuckDB's columnar format and Parquet support enable:
   - Direct integration with data science tools
   - Efficient data export for analysis
   - Archival storage in industry-standard formats

## Stakeholders

### Direct Users
- **AttributeIndex**: Primary consumer needing efficient queries
- **Future Query Interface**: Will leverage SQL capabilities
- **Analytics Components**: Dashboard and reporting features

### Indirect Beneficiaries
- **End Users**: Faster query responses, richer analytics
- **Data Scientists**: Direct access to analytical database
- **System Operators**: Better performance monitoring

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
1. **Storage Interface Compliance**: Implements all required Storage<T> methods
2. **SQL Query Support**: Enables complex analytical queries beyond key-value
3. **Parquet Integration**: Import/export capabilities for data exchange
4. **Transaction Support**: ACID compliance for data integrity

### Performance Success
1. **Query Speed**: 10x faster aggregations than JSON adapter for 100k+ entities
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Columnar compression reduces memory footprint
3. **Concurrent Access**: Multiple readers without blocking
4. **Batch Operations**: Efficient bulk inserts via appender API

### Integration Success
1. **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing AttributeIndex without changes
2. **Adapter Pattern**: Follows established BaseStorageAdapter patterns
3. **Test Coverage**: Passes all storage interface compliance tests
4. **Configuration**: Simple setup via DuckDBStorageConfig

## Current State Analysis

### What Exists
- **Storage Abstraction**: Complete interface and base class
- **JSON Adapter**: Reference implementation showing patterns
- **Memory Adapter**: In-memory implementation for comparison
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive compliance tests

### What's Missing
- **Columnar Storage**: No current adapter uses columnar format
- **SQL Capabilities**: No adapter supports SQL queries
- **Analytics Functions**: No aggregation or statistical functions
- **Parquet Support**: No import/export to analytical formats

### Integration Points
1. **BaseStorageAdapter**: Provides common functionality
2. **Storage Interface**: Defines required methods
3. **AttributeIndex**: Primary consumer of storage
4. **FileIOHandler**: May be useful for file operations

## Constraints and Boundaries

### Technical Constraints
1. **Must use `@duckdb/node-api`**: Selected for TypeScript support
2. **Must extend BaseStorageAdapter**: For consistency
3. **Must handle type serialization**: DuckDB has specific type requirements
4. **Must support both patterns**: Key-value AND columnar queries

### Architectural Boundaries
1. **Storage Layer Only**: Don't leak SQL into business logic
2. **Adapter Pattern**: Maintain abstraction, don't break encapsulation
3. **No Direct File Access**: Use DuckDB's file handling
4. **Configuration via Interface**: Use established config patterns

### Operational Constraints
1. **Embedded Database**: No external server dependencies
2. **File Permissions**: Must handle database file access
3. **Concurrent Access**: Handle multiple connections safely
4. **Resource Cleanup**: Proper connection management

## Problem Validation

### Research Findings
- DuckDB provides excellent TypeScript bindings via `@duckdb/node-api`
- Columnar storage offers 5-100x compression for analytical data
- Parquet support enables zero-copy data exchange
- Transaction support ensures data consistency

### Assumptions to Validate
1. **Type Mapping**: Can serialize all Entity types to DuckDB
2. **Performance**: Columnar storage benefits outweigh overhead
3. **Compatibility**: Can maintain Storage<T> interface semantics
4. **Concurrency**: DuckDB handles concurrent access appropriately

## Definition of Done

The problem is solved when:
1. **Functional**: All Storage<T> methods work with DuckDB backend
2. **Performant**: Demonstrates measurable speed improvements
3. **Integrated**: Works seamlessly with AttributeIndex
4. **Tested**: Passes all compliance and performance tests
5. **Documented**: Usage guide and examples provided
6. **Maintainable**: Clean code following project patterns
