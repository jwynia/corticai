- Foundation: ✅ Solid and well-architected
- Quality: ✅ High standards maintained (encapsulation, type safety, security)

## Planning Principles

### Integration Over Separation
- Research tasks are first-class work items
- Validation happens before implementation
- Learning is documented as we go

### Dependency-Driven Sequencing
- Work is ordered by what enables what
- Blockers are explicitly identified
- Parallel work is highlighted

### Value-Focused Prioritization
- Validate risky assumptions early
- Deliver working pieces incrementally
- Defer optimization until foundation is solid

### Reality-Driven Planning (NEW 2025-10-11)
- Groom backlog against actual code implementation
- Archive completed tasks
- Update plans based on discoveries
- Maintain single source of truth

## How to Use Planning Documents

### For Daily Work
1. Check [Groomed Backlog](./groomed-backlog.md) for ready tasks
2. Look at [Sprint Plan](./sprint-next.md) for current priorities
3. Pick top unblocked task
4. Update status when complete

### For Sprint Planning
1. Review [Groomed Backlog](./groomed-backlog.md) top priorities
2. Select tasks that advance current milestone
3. Balance quick wins with high-impact work
4. Update [Sprint Plan](./sprint-next.md) with selections

### For Strategic Updates
1. Review [Roadmap](./roadmap.md) quarterly
2. Update phase status based on milestones
3. Run `/sync` and `/groom` commands regularly
4. Document major pivots in decisions
