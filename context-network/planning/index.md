# Planning Index

## Purpose
Central navigation point for all project planning, prioritization, and task management. This section contains the roadmap, backlog, and implementation strategy.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

- [Implementation Phases](./implementation_phases.md) - Detailed phase dependencies and approach
- [Milestones](./milestones.md) - Key delivery targets

### Future Phases Planning
- [Cosmos DB Integration Plan](./cosmos-db-integration-plan.md) - Cloud storage architecture strategy
- **â†’ [Cosmos Storage Tasks](./backlog/cosmos-storage-tasks.md)** - Detailed task breakdown for cloud deployment

### Validation & Meta-Planning
- [CorticAI Validation Cases](./corticai-validation-cases.md) - How CorticAI proves its value by solving its own coordination problems
- [Self-Hosting Transition Strategy](./self-hosting-transition-strategy.md) - Progressive transition from manual to automated context management
- **â†’ [Reference Network Testing Strategy](./reference-network-testing-strategy.md)** - Comprehensive testing approach using external context networks
- **â†’ [Reference Network Test Plan](./reference-network-test-plan.md)** - Detailed test specifications and scenarios

### Legacy Backlogs (Being Migrated)

- [Research Backlog](./research_backlog.md) - Research-specific tasks

## Current Status

### Active Phase
**Phase 1: Core Engine âœ… EXCEEDED SCOPE**
- KuzuStorageAdapter âœ… COMPLETE (Enhanced with security & performance)
- QueryBuilder/QueryExecutor âœ… COMPLETE (23K+ lines, comprehensive)
- UniversalFallbackAdapter âœ… COMPLETE (Domain-agnostic foundation)
- ContextInitializer âœ… COMPLETE (Three-tier memory model)
- Context Analysis System ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS (80% - Final testing phase)

### Recently Completed
âœ… **Phase 1 Core Engine** - Exceeded planned scope with security & performance enhancements
âœ… **Use Case Analysis** - Place context validated design choices
âœ… **Comprehensive Test Suite** - 37 test files across all components

### COMPLETED PHASES âœ…
- **Phase 1 Core Engine** âœ… COMPLETE - Universal Context Engine foundation
- **Phase 2 Progressive Loading** âœ… COMPLETE - 5-depth system with 80% memory reduction
- **Phase 3 Lens Foundation** âœ… COMPLETE - Complete lens architecture with activation detection
- **First Domain Solution** âœ… COMPLETE - NovelAdapter proving cross-domain versatility

### CURRENT PRIORITY: User-Facing Value Phase ðŸŽ¯
**â†’ [Next Phase Implementation Plan](./next-phase-implementation/)** - Strategic transition from foundation to user value
- Domain Versatility Stream: CodebaseAdapter, DocumentationAdapter
- Intelligence Stream: DebugLens, DocumentationLens
- Integration Stream: Performance optimization, integration testing
- **Status**: PLANNING COMPLETE âœ… - Ready for grooming and implementation

### Key Decisions Pending
- File watching library choice
- Memory consolidation strategy

### Future Architecture Decisions
- **Cloud Storage Strategy**: Cosmos DB dual-role architecture planned for Phase 7
  - **Context**: Local-first development with cloud-native deployment capability
  - **Decision Point**: After Phase 5 completion, before production scaling needs
  - **Detail Available**: [[cosmos-db-integration-plan]] and [[cosmos-storage-tasks]]

## Planning Principles

### Integration Over Separation
- Research tasks are first-class work items
- Validation happens before implementation
- Learning is documented as we go

### Dependency-Driven Sequencing
- Work is ordered by what enables what
- Blockers are explicitly identified
- Parallel work is highlighted

### Value-Focused Prioritization
- Validate risky assumptions early
- Deliver working pieces incrementally
- Defer optimization and nice-to-haves

## How to Use Planning Documents

### For Daily Work
1. Check [Unified Backlog](./unified_backlog.md) for next task
2. Look at "Next Up Queue" section
3. Pick top unblocked task
4. Update status when complete

### For Sprint Planning
1. Review validation milestones
2. Select tasks that advance milestones
3. Balance research with implementation
4. Include decision points that need resolution

### For Strategic Updates
1. Review [Roadmap](./roadmap.md) quarterly
2. Update phase status based on milestones
3. Adjust based on research findings
4. Document major pivots in decisions

## Task Types

### Research Tasks
- Validate assumptions
- Explore technical approaches
- Create proof of concepts
- Document findings

### Implementation Tasks
- Build core components
- Integrate systems
- Create production code
- Write tests

### Validation Tasks
- Confirm cross-domain application
- Benchmark performance
- Test scalability
- Verify user value

## Success Tracking
