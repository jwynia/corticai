# Planning Index

## Purpose
Central navigation point for all project planning, prioritization, and task management. This section contains the roadmap, backlog, and implementation strategy.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Primary Planning Documents

### ðŸŽ¯ Start Here for Task Selection
â†’ **[Unified Backlog](./unified_backlog.md)** - Single source of truth for ALL work items (research + implementation)

### Strategic Planning
- [Roadmap](./roadmap.md) - High-level project phases and vision
- [Implementation Phases](./implementation_phases.md) - Detailed phase dependencies and approach
- [Milestones](./milestones.md) - Key delivery targets

### Specialized Backlogs (Reference Only)
- [Research Backlog](./research_backlog.md) - Detailed research tasks (integrated into unified backlog)

## Current Status

### Active Phase
**Research & Validation** - Proving core concepts work before full implementation

### Next Up (From Unified Backlog)
1. Build Universal Fallback Adapter
2. Prototype TypeScript Dependency Detection  
3. Create Basic Attribute Index
4. Build Simple Novel Adapter

### Key Decisions Pending
- File watching library choice
- Memory consolidation strategy

## Planning Principles

### Integration Over Separation
- Research tasks are first-class work items
- Validation happens before implementation
- Learning is documented as we go

### Dependency-Driven Sequencing
- Work is ordered by what enables what
- Blockers are explicitly identified
- Parallel work is highlighted

### Value-Focused Prioritization
- Validate risky assumptions early
- Deliver working pieces incrementally
- Defer optimization and nice-to-haves

## How to Use Planning Documents

### For Daily Work
1. Check [Unified Backlog](./unified_backlog.md) for next task
2. Look at "Next Up Queue" section
3. Pick top unblocked task
4. Update status when complete

### For Sprint Planning
1. Review validation milestones
2. Select tasks that advance milestones
3. Balance research with implementation
4. Include decision points that need resolution

### For Strategic Updates
1. Review [Roadmap](./roadmap.md) quarterly
2. Update phase status based on milestones
3. Adjust based on research findings
4. Document major pivots in decisions

## Task Types

### Research Tasks
- Validate assumptions
- Explore technical approaches
- Create proof of concepts
- Document findings

### Implementation Tasks
- Build core components
- Integrate systems
- Create production code
- Write tests

### Validation Tasks
- Confirm cross-domain application
- Benchmark performance
- Test scalability
- Verify user value

## Success Tracking

### Current Progress
- Research documents created: 15+
- Core concepts validated: In progress
- Proof of concepts: 0/6
- Production components: 0/5

### Validation Checkpoints
- [ ] Universal entity extraction works
- [ ] Dependency tracking validated
- [ ] Attribute queries functional
- [ ] Cross-domain patterns confirmed
- [ ] Refactoring safety proven
