# Storage Abstraction Task Sequence

## Overview

This plan details the implementation sequence for creating a robust storage abstraction layer that will serve as the foundation for CorticAI's evolution from JSON files to graph databases and beyond.

## Current State

- **Storage**: Direct JSON file I/O in AttributeIndex
- **Coupling**: Tight coupling between storage and business logic
- **Limitations**: No abstraction, no backend flexibility, memory constraints

## Target State

- **Storage**: Pluggable storage backends via abstraction layer
- **Decoupling**: Complete separation of storage from business logic
- **Capabilities**: Support for JSON, DuckDB, Graph DB, and distributed storage

## Implementation Philosophy

1. **Interface-First Design**: Define contracts before implementation
2. **Incremental Migration**: Maintain backward compatibility throughout
3. **Test-Driven**: Each abstraction level fully tested before proceeding
4. **Performance-Aware**: Measure impact at each step

## Task Sequence Structure

The implementation is organized into 5 sequential stages:

1. **Stage 1**: Storage Interface Definition
2. **Stage 2**: Current State Adapter (JSON)
3. **Stage 3**: Enhanced Capabilities
4. **Stage 4**: Alternative Backends
5. **Stage 5**: Migration and Optimization

Each stage builds upon the previous, ensuring system stability at every step.

## Success Criteria

- Zero breaking changes to existing functionality
- Performance parity or improvement
- Support for at least 3 storage backends
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Clean migration path from current implementation

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Strategy Pattern**: For pluggable storage backends
2. **Async-First**: All operations return Promises
3. **Batch Operations**: Support for bulk operations
4. **Transaction Support**: Prepare for ACID requirements
5. **Event System**: Storage lifecycle hooks

## Risk Mitigation

- Parallel implementation (old and new systems coexist)
- Feature flags for gradual rollout
- Comprehensive backup before migration
- Rollback strategy at each stage
