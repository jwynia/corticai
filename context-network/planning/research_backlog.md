- [ ] Return results sorted by relevance
- [ ] Handle 10,000+ entities efficiently

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Use Map<AttributeKey, Set<EntityId>> structure
2. Implement intersection/union for multi-attribute queries
3. Add attribute scoring/weighting system
4. Test with synthetic dataset of various sizes

**Watch Out For**: Memory usage with large datasets, attribute key normalization

### 4. Create Simple Novel Chapter Adapter
**One-liner**: Build domain adapter for novel/story files demonstrating non-code use
**Effort**: 5-6 hours
**Files to modify**: 
- Create: `/src/adapters/NovelAdapter.ts`
- Create: `/examples/novel-project/`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Prove the system works beyond code with narrative content
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Detect chapters and scenes
- [ ] Extract character names (proper nouns)
- [ ] Identify locations/settings
- [ ] Create character appearance relationships
- [ ] Generate timeline from chapter order

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Use regex for chapter detection (Chapter #, Ch., etc.)
2. Extract proper nouns for character detection
3. Look for setting indicators ("at the", "in the")
4. Build co-occurrence matrix for characters
5. Test with public domain novel text

**Watch Out For**: False positives in name detection, handling different chapter formats

</details>

## üîç Needs Decisions

### 7. Memory Consolidation Strategy
**Decision needed**: When and how to trigger consolidation?
**Options**: 
1. Time-based (every N minutes)
2. Memory pressure (when working set > threshold)
3. Event-based (after N changes)
4. Manual only

**Recommendation**: Start with manual, add time-based later

---

### 8. File Watching Technology
**Decision needed**: Which file monitoring library to use?
**Options**: 
1. Chokidar - Most popular, cross-platform
2. Node native fs.watch - Fastest but platform quirks
3. Facebook Watchman - Most scalable
4. Custom polling - Most control

**Recommendation**: Start with Chokidar for compatibility
