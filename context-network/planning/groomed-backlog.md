## üîß DEFERRED: Advanced Features (After Foundation Complete)

### Lens System Implementation - BLOCKED
**Status**: BLOCKED until foundation is stable
**Reason**: Cannot build advanced features on unstable foundation
**Tasks**: DebugLens, DocumentationLens, etc.
**Unblock Criteria**: Tasks F1, F2, A1, A2 must be 100% complete

### Performance Optimization - BLOCKED
**Status**: BLOCKED until basic functionality works
**Reason**: Premature optimization on broken foundation
**Unblock Criteria**: All foundation tasks complete with passing tests

### Integration Testing - BLOCKED
**Status**: BLOCKED until components individually work
**Reason**: Cannot test integration of broken components
**Unblock Criteria**: Individual adapters fully functional

## üìÖ Sprint Planning Recommendations

### CRITICAL: Foundation Week (Week 1)
**Primary Focus**: Fix fundamental issues before any feature work
- **Foundation**: Fix Linting Issues (F1) - 2-3 hours
- **Foundation**: Fix Test Infrastructure (F2) - 4-6 hours
- **Core**: Complete UniversalFallbackAdapter (A1) - 4-6 hours

**Total Effort**: 10-15 hours
**Deliverables**: Clean build, passing tests, stable foundation
**Success Criteria**: npm run lint passes, npm test passes, no CONNECTION_FAILED errors

### Week 2: Core Adapter Completion
**Primary Focus**: Complete and validate domain adapters
- **Core**: Complete CodebaseAdapter (A2) - 3-4 hours
- **Validation**: Validate NovelAdapter (A3) - 2-3 hours
- **Quality**: Add comprehensive examples and documentation

**Total Effort**: 8-12 hours
**Deliverables**: Two fully functional domain adapters
**Success Criteria**: All adapters working, tests passing, examples functional

### Week 3+: Advanced Features (ONLY if foundation complete)
**Primary Focus**: Advanced features (contingent on Week 1-2 success)
- **Advanced**: Lens system implementation
