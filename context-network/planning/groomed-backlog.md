## üöÄ Ready for Implementation

### 1. Assess Current Development Phase
**One-liner**: Determine actual current phase (4+ likely) and update roadmap to reflect implementation reality
**Complexity**: Medium (1-2 hours)
**Priority**: HIGH - Strategic planning alignment
**Dependencies**: Discovery records helpful but not required

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Sync report reveals project is ~2 phases ahead of documented status. Need strategic assessment of actual current state and roadmap realignment.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Review actual implementation completeness of Phases 1-3
- [ ] Assess Phase 4 (Domain Adapters) progress - NovelAdapter complete, others status?
- [ ] Determine if Phase 5 (Extensions) is current priority
- [ ] Update `planning/roadmap.md` with reality-based phases
- [ ] Document phase transition criteria
- [ ] Update milestone tracking
- [ ] Validate next phase readiness

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Audit all implemented features against original phase definitions
2. Map current implementations to phase completion criteria
3. Identify what work remains in current phase
4. Determine strategic priorities for next phase
5. Update roadmap and planning documents

**Files to modify**:
- `context-network/planning/roadmap.md` (update phases)
- `context-network/planning/milestones.md` (update progress)
- Related planning documents

**Watch Out For**: This requires strategic decision-making - consider team alignment needs

### 2. Update System Architecture Documentation
**One-liner**: Reflect Progressive Loading and Lens System integration in architecture documentation
**Complexity**: Medium (2-3 hours)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Architectural clarity
**Dependencies**: None - discovery records are already complete

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Architecture documentation needs updating to reflect the already-implemented Progressive Loading and Lens System components documented in discovery records.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Update `architecture/system_architecture.md` with progressive loading
- [ ] Document lens system integration in `architecture/component_map.md`
- [ ] Update `architecture/data_architecture.md` with depth-aware queries
- [ ] Reflect new components in `architecture/integration_patterns.md`
- [ ] Create/update architectural diagrams if needed
- [ ] Document performance implications
- [ ] Update cross-references

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Review existing discovery records (lens-system.md, novel-adapter.md) for component details
2. Map progressive loading impact on system architecture
3. Document lens system integration patterns from existing implementation
4. Update component relationships in architecture docs
5. Validate integration patterns against actual code

**Files to modify**:
- `context-network/architecture/system_architecture.md`
- `context-network/architecture/component_map.md`
- `context-network/architecture/data_architecture.md`
- `context-network/architecture/integration_patterns.md`

**Watch Out For**: Ensure architectural accuracy by reviewing actual implementations

</details>

### 3. Complete CodebaseAdapter Implementation
**One-liner**: Complete the CodebaseAdapter implementation to prove domain adapter pattern scalability
**Complexity**: Large (4-6 hours)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Proves adapter framework
**Dependencies**: Understanding of current adapter implementations

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: NovelAdapter proves cross-domain capability. CodebaseAdapter would demonstrate the pattern works for technical domains and provides practical value.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Complete CodebaseAdapter implementation in `app/src/adapters/CodebaseAdapter.ts`
- [ ] Implement TypeScript AST parsing for functions, classes, interfaces
- [ ] Add import/export dependency tracking
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add usage examples and documentation
- [ ] Validate integration with storage system
- [ ] Performance test with realistic codebases

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Review existing NovelAdapter and UniversalFallbackAdapter patterns
2. Implement TypeScript Compiler API integration
3. Add entity extraction for code constructs
4. Implement relationship detection for dependencies
5. Create comprehensive tests
6. Add performance optimization

**Files to modify**:
- `app/src/adapters/CodebaseAdapter.ts` (main implementation)
- `app/tests/adapters/codebase.test.ts` (tests)
- Example and documentation files

**Watch Out For**: Performance with large codebases, ensure incremental processing

</details>

### 4. Quick Win: Edge Type Filtering Performance Optimization
**One-liner**: Complete TODO in KuzuSecureQueryBuilder for variable-length path filtering performance
**Complexity**: Small (85 minutes)
**Priority**: LOW - Performance optimization when time permits
**Dependencies**: None - isolated improvement

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Edge type filtering for variable-length graph traversal is handled in post-processing rather than query-level, impacting performance for large graphs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Research Kuzu's variable-length path filtering capabilities
- [ ] Implement query-level filtering if supported
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks comparing approaches
- [ ] Update documentation and remove TODO comment
- [ ] Ensure existing tests pass

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Investigate Kuzu documentation for variable-length path filtering
2. Create performance test with large graph dataset
3. Implement query-level filtering if supported
4. Benchmark both approaches and choose optimal solution

**Files to modify**:
- `app/src/storage/adapters/KuzuSecureQueryBuilder.ts:109-111`

**Watch Out For**: May be limited by Kuzu version capabilities - validate first

</details>

## ‚è≥ Ready Soon (Blocked)

### Implement Sync Automation Process
**Blocker**: Requires process design and tooling decisions
**Unblocks after**: Team discussion on automation approach
**Prep work possible**: Research git hook options and CI/CD integration patterns

### Advanced Lens Implementations (DebugLens, DocumentationLens)
**Blocker**: Depends on lens system usage patterns
**Unblocks after**: Discovery records complete + current phase assessment
**Prep work possible**: Review existing lens infrastructure and requirements

## üîç Needs Decisions

### Production Readiness Assessment
**Decision needed**: What constitutes "production ready" for CorticAI?
**Options**:
- Focus on proof-of-concept completion (current state + docs)
- Build towards actual deployment (cloud integration, scaling)
- Optimize for development team usage (tooling, examples)
**Recommendation**: Define specific production criteria based on intended usage

### Phase 5+ Priority Selection
**Decision needed**: Which advanced features provide most value?
**Options**: Pattern detection, external integrations, performance optimization, cloud deployment
**Recommendation**: Assess after current phase documentation complete

## üóëÔ∏è Archived Tasks

### Foundation Issues (F1, F2) - **Reason**: Based on outdated assessment, actual foundation is solid
### Universal Adapter Completion (A1) - **Reason**: Already implemented and tested
### Basic Lens System - **Reason**: Already complete per sync findings
### Create Discovery Records - **Reason**: Already complete - lens-system.md, novel-adapter.md exist with comprehensive documentation

---

## Summary Statistics
- Total tasks reviewed: 58 task files + planning documents
- Ready for work: 4 prioritized tasks (3 strategic + 1 quick win)
- Blocked: 2 tasks awaiting decisions/design
- Archived: 6 tasks based on outdated assessment
- Tech debt opportunities: 5 deferred items with clear acceptance criteria

## Top 3 Recommendations
1. **Assess Current Phase** - Strategic alignment essential for proper planning
2. **Complete CodebaseAdapter** - Proves domain adapter scalability, delivers practical value (14/18 tests already passing)
3. **Update Architecture Docs** - Reflect implemented systems in documentation

---

## Context Integration

**Parent Planning**: [planning/index.md](./index.md) - Central planning navigation
**Related Planning**: [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md) - Strategic context
**Recent Updates**: Based on sync report findings from 2025-09-26

This groomed backlog reflects the actual implementation state discovered during the sync process, prioritizing documentation alignment and next-phase implementation over foundation work that is already complete.
