## üöÄ Ready for Implementation

### 1. Create Comprehensive Discovery Records
**One-liner**: Document the major implemented components (Progressive Loading, Lens System, NovelAdapter) in proper discovery records
**Complexity**: Small (1-2 hours)
**Priority**: HIGH - Critical for knowledge management
**Dependencies**: None - implementation already exists

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Sync report identified that major implementations exist but lack proper discovery records in the context network. This creates knowledge management gaps and prevents effective onboarding.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Create `discoveries/locations/progressive-loading.md` documenting ContextDepth implementation
- [ ] Create `discoveries/locations/lens-system.md` documenting lens infrastructure
- [ ] Create `discoveries/locations/novel-adapter.md` documenting domain adapter proof
- [ ] Update location indexes with new discoveries
- [ ] Cross-link related concept documents
- [ ] Follow discovery record format from CLAUDE.md

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Review actual implementation in `app/src/types/context.ts` (ContextDepth)
2. Review lens system in `app/src/context/lenses/` directory
3. Review NovelAdapter in `app/src/adapters/NovelAdapter.ts`
4. Create discovery records following established format
5. Update indexes and cross-references

**Files to modify**:
- `context-network/discoveries/locations/progressive-loading.md` (create)
- `context-network/discoveries/locations/lens-system.md` (create)
- `context-network/discoveries/locations/novel-adapter.md` (create)
- Related location index files (update)

**Watch Out For**: Ensure accuracy by reading actual implementation, not documentation

</details>

### 2. Assess Current Development Phase
**One-liner**: Determine actual current phase (4+ likely) and update roadmap to reflect implementation reality
**Complexity**: Medium (1-2 hours)
**Priority**: HIGH - Strategic planning alignment
**Dependencies**: Discovery records helpful but not required

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Sync report reveals project is ~2 phases ahead of documented status. Need strategic assessment of actual current state and roadmap realignment.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Review actual implementation completeness of Phases 1-3
- [ ] Assess Phase 4 (Domain Adapters) progress - NovelAdapter complete, others status?
- [ ] Determine if Phase 5 (Extensions) is current priority
- [ ] Update `planning/roadmap.md` with reality-based phases
- [ ] Document phase transition criteria
- [ ] Update milestone tracking
- [ ] Validate next phase readiness

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Audit all implemented features against original phase definitions
2. Map current implementations to phase completion criteria
3. Identify what work remains in current phase
4. Determine strategic priorities for next phase
5. Update roadmap and planning documents

**Files to modify**:
- `context-network/planning/roadmap.md` (update phases)
- `context-network/planning/milestones.md` (update progress)
- Related planning documents

**Watch Out For**: This requires strategic decision-making - consider team alignment needs

</details>

### 3. Update System Architecture Documentation
**One-liner**: Reflect Progressive Loading and Lens System integration in architecture documentation
**Complexity**: Medium (2-3 hours)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Architectural clarity
**Dependencies**: Discovery records should be completed first

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Architecture documentation doesn't reflect progressive loading and lens system integration points, creating architectural blind spots.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Update `architecture/system_architecture.md` with progressive loading
- [ ] Document lens system integration in `architecture/component_map.md`
- [ ] Update `architecture/data_architecture.md` with depth-aware queries
- [ ] Reflect new components in `architecture/integration_patterns.md`
- [ ] Create/update architectural diagrams if needed
- [ ] Document performance implications
- [ ] Update cross-references

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Review discovery records for component details
2. Map progressive loading impact on system architecture
3. Document lens system integration patterns
4. Update component relationships
5. Validate integration patterns

**Files to modify**:
- `context-network/architecture/system_architecture.md`
- `context-network/architecture/component_map.md`
- `context-network/architecture/data_architecture.md`
- `context-network/architecture/integration_patterns.md`

**Watch Out For**: Ensure architectural accuracy by reviewing actual implementations

</details>

### 4. Implement Next Domain Adapter (CodebaseAdapter)
**One-liner**: Complete the CodebaseAdapter implementation to prove domain adapter pattern scalability
**Complexity**: Large (4-6 hours)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Proves adapter framework
**Dependencies**: Understanding of current adapter implementations

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: NovelAdapter proves cross-domain capability. CodebaseAdapter would demonstrate the pattern works for technical domains and provides practical value.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Complete CodebaseAdapter implementation in `app/src/adapters/CodebaseAdapter.ts`
- [ ] Implement TypeScript AST parsing for functions, classes, interfaces
- [ ] Add import/export dependency tracking
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite
- [ ] Add usage examples and documentation
- [ ] Validate integration with storage system
- [ ] Performance test with realistic codebases

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Review existing NovelAdapter and UniversalFallbackAdapter patterns
2. Implement TypeScript Compiler API integration
3. Add entity extraction for code constructs
4. Implement relationship detection for dependencies
5. Create comprehensive tests
6. Add performance optimization

**Files to modify**:
- `app/src/adapters/CodebaseAdapter.ts` (main implementation)
- `app/tests/adapters/codebase.test.ts` (tests)
- Example and documentation files

**Watch Out For**: Performance with large codebases, ensure incremental processing

</details>

## ‚è≥ Ready Soon (Blocked)

### Implement Sync Automation Process
**Blocker**: Requires process design and tooling decisions
**Unblocks after**: Team discussion on automation approach
**Prep work possible**: Research git hook options and CI/CD integration patterns

### Advanced Lens Implementations (DebugLens, DocumentationLens)
**Blocker**: Depends on lens system usage patterns
**Unblocks after**: Discovery records complete + current phase assessment
**Prep work possible**: Review existing lens infrastructure and requirements

## üîç Needs Decisions

### Production Readiness Assessment
**Decision needed**: What constitutes "production ready" for CorticAI?
**Options**:
- Focus on proof-of-concept completion (current state + docs)
- Build towards actual deployment (cloud integration, scaling)
- Optimize for development team usage (tooling, examples)
**Recommendation**: Define specific production criteria based on intended usage

### Phase 5+ Priority Selection
**Decision needed**: Which advanced features provide most value?
**Options**: Pattern detection, external integrations, performance optimization, cloud deployment
**Recommendation**: Assess after current phase documentation complete

## üóëÔ∏è Archived Tasks

### Foundation Issues (F1, F2) - **Reason**: Based on outdated assessment, actual foundation is solid
### Universal Adapter Completion (A1) - **Reason**: Already implemented and tested
### Basic Lens System - **Reason**: Already complete per sync findings

---

## Summary Statistics
- Total tasks reviewed: 58 task files + planning documents
- Ready for work: 4 prioritized tasks
- Blocked: 2 tasks awaiting decisions/design
- Archived: 6 tasks based on outdated assessment

## Top 3 Recommendations
1. **Create Discovery Records** - Critical knowledge management gap, enables all other work
2. **Assess Current Phase** - Strategic alignment essential for proper planning
3. **Complete CodebaseAdapter** - Proves domain adapter scalability, delivers practical value

---

## Context Integration

**Parent Planning**: [planning/index.md](./index.md) - Central planning navigation
**Related Planning**: [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md) - Strategic context
**Recent Updates**: Based on sync report findings from 2025-09-26

This groomed backlog reflects the actual implementation state discovered during the sync process, prioritizing documentation alignment and next-phase implementation over foundation work that is already complete.
