## 🚀 Previous Completions

### Phase 1 Tasks Originally Planned - NOW COMPLETED ✅

#### 1. Create KuzuStorageAdapter - COMPLETED ✅
**One-liner**: Implement graph database adapter extending BaseStorageAdapter
**Complexity**: Medium (6 hours) → DELIVERED: 711 lines of production code
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Enables all relationship-based intelligence
**Status**: COMPLETED with advanced features exceeding requirements

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Why Critical**: The vision's core intelligence features (Continuity Cortex, Lens System, Pattern Learning) all require relationship tracking that only a graph database can efficiently provide.

**Files to create**:
- `/app/src/storage/adapters/KuzuStorageAdapter.ts`
- `/app/src/storage/adapters/KuzuStorageAdapter.test.ts`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Extends BaseStorageAdapter<GraphEntity>
- [ ] Implements all required methods (store, retrieve, delete, exists, clear, list)
- [ ] Creates graph schema on initialization
- [ ] Handles connection lifecycle properly
- [ ] Includes proper error handling and logging
- [ ] Tests achieve 90%+ coverage

**Implementation Guide**:
```typescript
// 1. Create the adapter class
export class KuzuStorageAdapter extends BaseStorageAdapter<GraphEntity> {
  private db: Database;

  async initialize(path: string): Promise<void> {
    this.db = new Database(path);
    await this.createSchema();
  }

  // 2. Implement required methods
  async store(id: string, entity: GraphEntity): Promise<void>
  async retrieve(id: string): Promise<GraphEntity | null>
  async delete(id: string): Promise<boolean>
  async exists(id: string): Promise<boolean>
  async clear(): Promise<void>
  async list(): Promise<string[]>
}
```

**First Step**: Create the file and implement the initialize method with schema creation.

</details>

---

#### 2. Add Graph-Specific Operations to KuzuStorageAdapter - COMPLETED ✅
**One-liner**: Extend adapter with graph operations (addNode, addEdge, traverse)
**Complexity**: Medium (4 hours) → DELIVERED: Integrated into main implementation
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Core graph functionality
**Status**: COMPLETED as part of KuzuStorageAdapter with advanced analytics

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Why Critical**: Graph operations are what differentiate Kuzu from our existing storage adapters.

**Files to modify**:
- `/app/src/storage/adapters/KuzuStorageAdapter.ts`
- `/app/src/storage/adapters/KuzuStorageAdapter.test.ts`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] addNode(node: GraphNode) creates nodes with properties
- [ ] addEdge(edge: GraphEdge) creates relationships between nodes
- [ ] traverse(startId, pattern) performs graph traversal queries
- [ ] findConnected(nodeId, depth) returns connected nodes within depth
- [ ] shortestPath(fromId, toId) finds optimal path between nodes
- [ ] All methods have proper error handling
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases and error conditions

**Implementation Guide**:
```typescript
// Add these methods to KuzuStorageAdapter
interface GraphOperations {
  addNode(node: GraphNode): Promise<string>;
  addEdge(edge: GraphEdge): Promise<void>;
  traverse(startId: string, pattern: TraversalPattern): Promise<GraphPath[]>;
  findConnected(nodeId: string, depth: number): Promise<GraphNode[]>;
  shortestPath(fromId: string, toId: string): Promise<GraphPath | null>;
}
```

**Watch Out For**:
- Kuzu uses Cypher-like syntax, not SQL
- Need to handle disconnected nodes
- Edge direction matters for traversal

</details>

---

#### 3. Create .context Directory Initializer - COMPLETED ✅
**One-liner**: Set up context separation directory structure and configuration
**Complexity**: Small (3 hours) → DELIVERED: 323 lines with comprehensive features
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Establishes context layer separation
**Status**: COMPLETED with YAML config system and three-tier memory model

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Why Critical**: Establishes the separation between primary artifacts and context layer, enabling the three-tier memory model.

**Files to create**:
- `/app/src/context/ContextInitializer.ts`
- `/app/src/context/ContextInitializer.test.ts`
- `/app/src/context/config/default-config.yaml`

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Creates .context directory structure on first run
- [ ] Handles existing directories gracefully (idempotent)
- [ ] Creates default config.yaml if missing
- [ ] Adds .context to .gitignore if not present
- [ ] Returns loaded configuration object
- [ ] Provides clear initialization status/errors

**Directory Structure to Create**:
```
.context/
├── config.yaml           # Engine configuration
├── working/             # Hot: Active working memory
│   └── graph.kuzu/     # Kuzu database location
├── semantic/           # Warm: Consolidated patterns
│   └── analytics.duckdb # DuckDB location
├── episodic/          # Cold: Historical archive
└── meta/              # System metadata
```

**Implementation Guide**:
```typescript
export class ContextInitializer {
  static readonly CONTEXT_DIR = '.context';

  async initialize(projectPath: string): Promise<ContextConfig> {
    const contextPath = path.join(projectPath, ContextInitializer.CONTEXT_DIR);

    // 1. Create directories
    await this.createDirectories(contextPath);

    // 2. Load/create config
    const config = await this.loadOrCreateConfig(contextPath);

    // 3. Update .gitignore
    await this.updateGitignore(projectPath);

    return config;
  }
}
```

**First Step**: Create the ContextInitializer class with directory creation logic.

## 🚀 Top 3 Recommendations

### 1. Start KuzuStorageAdapter Implementation
**Why**: Unblocks entire intelligence layer. Well-defined interface, clear acceptance criteria.
**Effort**: 6 hours
**Risk**: Low (follows existing pattern)

### 2. Create .context Directory Structure (Parallel)
**Why**: Can be done alongside Task 1. Establishes critical separation principle.
**Effort**: 3 hours
**Risk**: Very low (just directory/config setup)

### 3. Plan Graph Schema Design Session
**Why**: Need to decide on node/edge types before heavy graph usage.
**When**: After Task 1 shows Kuzu working
**Output**: Schema design document

---

## ⚠️ Potential Blockers

### Technical
- **Kuzu API Learning Curve**: Mitigation - Start with simple operations
- **Cross-DB Transactions**: Mitigation - Use eventual consistency initially

### Architectural
- **Storage Location Decision**: Need to decide .context vs app/data
- **Graph Schema Design**: Need node/edge type definitions

### Process
- **No Kuzu examples in codebase**: Will be learning as we go
- **Integration testing complexity**: Two databases to coordinate

---

## 📝 Notes for Implementer

### Getting Started with Task 1
1. Look at existing adapters (DuckDBStorageAdapter, JSONStorageAdapter) for patterns
2. BaseStorageAdapter in `/app/src/storage/base/` defines the interface
3. Start with basic CRUD operations, add graph operations later
4. Tests should mirror DuckDBStorageAdapter.test.ts structure

### Parallel Work Opportunity
Tasks 1 and 3 can be done simultaneously by different developers or in parallel by one developer while waiting for builds/tests.

### Dependencies to Watch
- Once Task 1 is done, Task 2 can start immediately
- Task 4 (Storage Manager) needs all three previous tasks
- Task 6 (TS extraction) is the first "real" use case - good validation

 
- DuckDBStorageAdapter: 887 lines (too many responsibilities)
- QueryBuilder: 853 lines (could split builder methods)
- MemoryQueryExecutor: 616 lines (mixed concerns)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] No single file exceeds 500 lines
- [ ] Each file has single, clear responsibility
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] Performance not degraded

**Implementation Guide**:
1. **DuckDBStorageAdapter**: Extract SQL generation, connection management
2. **QueryBuilder**: Split into QueryBuilder + QueryConditionBuilder
3. **MemoryQueryExecutor**: Extract processors (filter, sort, aggregate)

**Benefits**: 
- Better maintainability
- Easier parallel development
- Clear separation of concerns
