## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 0. Fix Build Quality Issues ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**One-liner**: Fixed 8 TypeScript errors and 1 test failure blocking production deployment
**Completed**: 2025-09-30
**Result**: Build now passes with 0 TypeScript errors, all critical tests passing

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Phase 7 CosmosDB implementation is 80% complete but has 7 TypeScript compilation errors and 3 test failures. Build process also times out. This blocks ALL production deployment and further development.

**Critical Issues**:
1. **Missing dependency**: @azure/identity not in package.json
2. **CosmosDB type errors**: PartitionKey type incompatibility
3. **LocalStorageProvider interface mismatches**: 3 signature errors
4. **CodebaseAdapter type error**: Relationship type mismatch
5. **Test failures**: Performance monitor log format, edge filtering
6. **Build timeout**: Process hangs after 2 minutes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add @azure/identity to package.json dependencies (CRITICAL)
- [ ] Fix CosmosDB partitionKey type error (line 256)
- [ ] Fix LocalStorageProvider getMany() return type (line 43)
- [ ] Fix LocalStorageProvider traverse() signature (line 47)
- [ ] Fix LocalStorageProvider findConnected() signature (line 69)
- [ ] Fix CodebaseAdapter "calls" relationship type (line 532)
- [ ] Update performance monitor tests for new log format
- [ ] Fix KuzuSecureQueryBuilder edge type filtering test
- [ ] Investigate and fix build timeout issue
- [ ] npm run build completes successfully in < 30 seconds
- [ ] npm test passes all tests with 0 failures

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Add @azure/identity to dependencies: `npm install @azure/identity`
2. Fix CosmosDB partitionKey: Use correct SDK types from @azure/cosmos
3. Fix LocalStorageProvider: Align interface signatures with PrimaryStorage
4. Fix CodebaseAdapter: Add "calls" to relationship type enum
5. Update test expectations for new logger output format
6. Fix edge type filtering logic in KuzuSecureQueryBuilder
7. Profile build process to identify timeout cause
8. Run full test suite and build to validate

**Files to modify**:
- `app/package.json` (add @azure/identity)
- `app/src/storage/adapters/CosmosDBStorageAdapter.ts` (fix partitionKey types)
- `app/src/storage/providers/LocalStorageProvider.ts` (fix interface mismatches)
- `app/src/adapters/CodebaseAdapter.ts` (fix relationship type)
- `app/src/storage/adapters/KuzuSecureQueryBuilder.ts` (fix edge filtering)
- `app/tests/**/performance.test.ts` (update log format expectations)

**Watch Out For**:
- Don't skip type checks by using `any` - fix the actual type mismatches
- Ensure LocalStorageProvider properly implements PrimaryStorage interface
- Validate CosmosDB types match the @azure/cosmos SDK version

**Evidence**: See `/context-network/tasks/sync-report-2025-09-30.md` for detailed analysis

- [x] Add comprehensive test suite for cloud operations (36 tests passing)
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation (CosmosDB-Integration-README.md)

**Remaining Work** (After Build Fixed):
- [ ] Fix all TypeScript compilation errors (see task #0 above)
- [ ] Add @azure/identity dependency
- [ ] Validate with real Azure CosmosDB instance (not just mocked tests)
- [ ] Complete bidirectional migration utilities
- [ ] Test migration with realistic data volumes

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Design storage provider abstraction layer
2. Implement CosmosDB adapter following established patterns
3. Create migration and synchronization utilities
4. Add environment configuration management
5. Build comprehensive test coverage
6. Document deployment procedures

**Files to modify**:
- `app/src/storage/adapters/CosmosDBStorageAdapter.ts` (new)
- `app/src/storage/providers/` (new directory)
- `app/src/config/storage.ts` (new)
- Test files and documentation

**Watch Out For**: CosmosDB RU cost optimization and consistency model considerations

### 4. Advanced Domain Adapter Framework
**One-liner**: Complete CodebaseAdapter and create domain adapter registry for extensibility
**Complexity**: Large (6-8 hours)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Proves extensibility model
**Dependencies**: Self-hosting validation helpful
**Azure Required**: ‚ùå No - Pure code development

## ‚è≥ Ready Soon (Blocked)

### External Integration Framework (GitHub, Issue Trackers)
**Blocker**: Requires production deployment strategy decision
**Unblocks after**: Cloud storage integration complete
**Prep work possible**: Research GitHub API integration patterns and webhook architecture

### Pattern Detection and Learning System
**Blocker**: Depends on sufficient usage data from self-hosting
**Unblocks after**: Self-hosting validation demonstrates usage patterns
**Prep work possible**: Design pattern recognition algorithms and data collection strategy

## üìù Technical Debt from Code TODOs

### Implement Edge Type Filtering for Variable-Length Paths
**Location**: `app/src/storage/adapters/KuzuSecureQueryBuilder.ts:109`
**Context**: Currently has a TODO comment indicating edge type filtering is not implemented for variable-length graph traversals
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Affects query precision but not blocking
**Complexity**: Small (1-2 hours)
**Dependencies**: Build must be fixed first
**Recommendation**: Address as part of Task #0 (Fix Build Quality Issues) since related test is already failing

---

## üîç Needs Decisions

### Strategic Focus Direction
**Decision needed**: Primary target market and deployment model for CorticAI?
**Options**:
- Enterprise development teams (cloud SaaS model)
- Open source development tool (self-hosted model)
- Research platform (academic/experimental focus)
- Internal Anthropic tooling (specialized internal use)
**Recommendation**: Enterprise development teams with cloud deployment - highest market value

### Technology Stack Evolution
**Decision needed**: Major technology upgrades for production scale?
**Options**:
- Migrate to PostgreSQL for better ACID guarantees
- Add Redis for caching and real-time features
- Implement GraphQL API for better client integration
- Add event sourcing for complete audit trails
**Recommendation**: Start with CosmosDB migration, add Redis caching as needed

## üóëÔ∏è Archived Tasks

### Foundation Infrastructure - **Reason**: Complete with 22+ major components, 383 tests, 14,200+ lines
### Basic Storage & Query Systems - **Reason**: Comprehensive implementation with multiple adapters
### Core Intelligence (Continuity Cortex) - **Reason**: Complete with FileDecisionEngine and similarity analysis
### Progressive Loading & Lens System - **Reason**: Full implementation with comprehensive test coverage
### Basic Domain Adapters - **Reason**: NovelAdapter and UniversalFallbackAdapter complete and tested
### Phase 1-3 Implementation Tasks - **Reason**: All foundational phases complete and exceeded scope

## Context Integration

**Parent Planning**: [planning/index.md](./index.md) - Central planning navigation
**Related Planning**: [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md) - Strategic context
**Recent Updates**:
- 2025-09-30: Post-sync grooming - Identified build quality blockers and updated task #0
- 2025-09-28: Comprehensive grooming - Confirmed Phase 7 in progress
- 2025-09-27: Major sync - Discovered Phases 2-3 complete

This groomed backlog reflects current reality: **BUILD BROKEN** but Phase 7 (Cloud Storage) 80% complete. All work is blocked until Task #0 (Fix Build Quality Issues) is completed. Once build passes, focus shifts to completing cloud storage validation and strategic production decisions.
