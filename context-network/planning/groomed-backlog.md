**Implementation Guide**:
```typescript
// Add these methods to KuzuStorageAdapter
interface GraphOperations {
  addNode(node: GraphNode): Promise<string>;
  addEdge(edge: GraphEdge): Promise<void>;
  traverse(startId: string, pattern: TraversalPattern): Promise<GraphPath[]>;
  findConnected(nodeId: string, depth: number): Promise<GraphNode[]>;
  shortestPath(fromId: string, toId: string): Promise<GraphPath | null>;
}
```

**Watch Out For**:
- Kuzu uses Cypher-like syntax, not SQL
- Need to handle disconnected nodes
- Edge direction matters for traversal

</details>

## 📝 Notes for Implementer

### Getting Started with Task 1
1. Look at existing adapters (DuckDBStorageAdapter, JSONStorageAdapter) for patterns
2. BaseStorageAdapter in `/app/src/storage/base/` defines the interface
3. Start with basic CRUD operations, add graph operations later
4. Tests should mirror DuckDBStorageAdapter.test.ts structure

### Parallel Work Opportunity
Tasks 1 and 3 can be done simultaneously by different developers or in parallel by one developer while waiting for builds/tests.

### Dependencies to Watch
- Once Task 1 is done, Task 2 can start immediately
- Task 4 (Storage Manager) needs all three previous tasks
- Task 6 (TS extraction) is the first "real" use case - good validation

 
- DuckDBStorageAdapter: 887 lines (too many responsibilities)
- QueryBuilder: 853 lines (could split builder methods)
- MemoryQueryExecutor: 616 lines (mixed concerns)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] No single file exceeds 500 lines
- [ ] Each file has single, clear responsibility
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
