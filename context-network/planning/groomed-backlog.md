## üöÄ Ready for Implementation

### 1. Strategic Production Readiness Assessment
**One-liner**: Define production readiness criteria and next strategic direction for CorticAI
**Complexity**: Medium (2-3 hours)
**Priority**: HIGH - Strategic alignment critical
**Dependencies**: None - foundational decision

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: With exceptional foundation complete (22+ components, 383 tests, Continuity Cortex), need strategic decision on production direction.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Define "production ready" criteria for CorticAI's intended use case
- [ ] Assess current capabilities against production criteria
- [ ] Identify gaps between current state and production goals
- [ ] Create strategic roadmap for next 2-3 phases
- [ ] Document deployment architecture requirements
- [ ] Validate cloud storage transition strategy

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Analyze current implementation against original vision
2. Define specific production deployment scenarios
3. Map technical gaps to strategic priorities
4. Create decision framework for next phase selection
5. Update roadmap with production-focused phases

**Files to modify**:
- `context-network/planning/roadmap.md` (strategic update)
- `context-network/planning/milestones.md` (production criteria)
- New production readiness assessment document

**Watch Out For**: Requires fundamental strategic decisions about system purpose and deployment

### 2. Azure Cloud Storage Integration
**One-liner**: Implement CosmosDB adapter to enable production cloud deployment
**Complexity**: Large (6-8 hours)
**Priority**: HIGH - Enables production deployment
**Dependencies**: Strategic direction confirmation

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Current implementation is local-only. Cloud storage integration enables production deployment and validates self-hosting capability.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Implement CosmosDBStorageAdapter with dual-role configuration
- [ ] Create storage provider abstraction (LocalStorageProvider, CosmosStorageProvider)
- [ ] Add bidirectional migration utilities between local and cloud storage
- [ ] Implement environment-based storage provider selection
- [ ] Create Azure deployment infrastructure configuration
- [ ] Add comprehensive test suite for cloud operations
- [ ] Validate feature parity between storage modes

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Design storage provider abstraction layer
2. Implement CosmosDB adapter following established patterns
3. Create migration and synchronization utilities
4. Add environment configuration management
5. Build comprehensive test coverage
6. Document deployment procedures

**Files to modify**:
- `app/src/storage/adapters/CosmosDBStorageAdapter.ts` (new)
- `app/src/storage/providers/` (new directory)
- `app/src/config/storage.ts` (new)
- Test files and documentation

**Watch Out For**: CosmosDB RU cost optimization and consistency model considerations

</details>

### 3. CorticAI Self-Hosting Validation
**One-liner**: Use CorticAI to manage its own development context and validate meta-capabilities
**Complexity**: Medium (4-5 hours)
**Priority**: HIGH - Validates core system value
**Dependencies**: Strategic assessment complete

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Ultimate validation of CorticAI is using it to manage its own complex development context, preventing the coordination problems it's designed to solve.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Configure CorticAI to index its own context network
- [ ] Validate entity extraction from planning documents
- [ ] Test cross-domain relationship detection (code ‚Üî planning)
- [ ] Verify lens system works with development contexts
- [ ] Document coordination problem prevention examples
- [ ] Measure context discovery performance vs manual navigation
- [ ] Create usage examples for other development teams

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Configure CorticAI to analyze its own context network
2. Create development-focused lens implementations
3. Test planning document entity extraction
4. Validate cross-references between code and planning
5. Document specific coordination improvements
6. Create templates for other projects

**Files to modify**:
- CorticAI configuration for self-analysis
- Development-specific lens implementations
- Usage documentation and examples
- Self-hosting validation reports

**Watch Out For**: Recursive complexity - ensure system doesn't create infinite meta-loops

</details>

### 4. Advanced Domain Adapter Framework
**One-liner**: Complete CodebaseAdapter and create domain adapter registry for extensibility
**Complexity**: Large (6-8 hours)
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Proves extensibility model
**Dependencies**: Self-hosting validation helpful

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: With NovelAdapter proving cross-domain capability, complete the technical domain adapter and create framework for easy extension.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Complete CodebaseAdapter with TypeScript AST parsing
- [ ] Implement domain adapter registry and loading system
- [ ] Create adapter composition for multi-domain projects
- [ ] Add natural language query translation for domain-specific queries
- [ ] Build adapter validation framework
- [ ] Create adapter development guide and templates
- [ ] Performance test with realistic codebases

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Complete CodebaseAdapter implementation following NovelAdapter patterns
2. Design domain adapter registry architecture
3. Implement dynamic adapter loading and composition
4. Create validation framework for adapter compliance
5. Add natural language query processing
6. Build comprehensive test suite

**Files to modify**:
- `app/src/adapters/CodebaseAdapter.ts` (complete implementation)
- `app/src/adapters/registry/` (new registry system)
- `app/src/adapters/validation/` (new validation framework)
- Tests and documentation

**Watch Out For**: Complexity of multi-adapter composition and query routing

</details>

## ‚è≥ Ready Soon (Blocked)

### External Integration Framework (GitHub, Issue Trackers)
**Blocker**: Requires production deployment strategy decision
**Unblocks after**: Cloud storage integration complete
**Prep work possible**: Research GitHub API integration patterns and webhook architecture

### Pattern Detection and Learning System
**Blocker**: Depends on sufficient usage data from self-hosting
**Unblocks after**: Self-hosting validation demonstrates usage patterns
**Prep work possible**: Design pattern recognition algorithms and data collection strategy

## üîç Needs Decisions

### Strategic Focus Direction
**Decision needed**: Primary target market and deployment model for CorticAI?
**Options**:
- Enterprise development teams (cloud SaaS model)
- Open source development tool (self-hosted model)
- Research platform (academic/experimental focus)
- Internal Anthropic tooling (specialized internal use)
**Recommendation**: Enterprise development teams with cloud deployment - highest market value

### Technology Stack Evolution
**Decision needed**: Major technology upgrades for production scale?
**Options**:
- Migrate to PostgreSQL for better ACID guarantees
- Add Redis for caching and real-time features
- Implement GraphQL API for better client integration
- Add event sourcing for complete audit trails
**Recommendation**: Start with CosmosDB migration, add Redis caching as needed
