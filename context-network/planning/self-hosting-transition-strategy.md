# Self-Hosting Transition Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the progressive transition from manual context management to CorticAI managing its own development context network. This transition serves as both validation of CorticAI's capabilities and a practical solution to the meta-coordination challenges we face while building the system.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Evolving
- **Lifecycle Stage:** Planning
- **Audience:** Architects, Developers

## The Meta-Coordination Challenge

### Current Manual Overhead
- **Planning Integration**: Must manually link new planning documents into existing hierarchy
- **Navigation Maintenance**: Must manually establish parent-child relationships
- **Context Discovery**: Fresh agents rely on manual documentation to find relevant prior work
- **Coordination Prevention**: Must manually check for conflicting or duplicate work

### Target Self-Hosting State
- **Automatic Integration**: CorticAI automatically links new planning work into proper hierarchy
- **Navigation Intelligence**: CorticAI suggests appropriate detail levels for context exploration
- **Context Assistance**: CorticAI helps agents discover relevant prior work automatically
- **Conflict Prevention**: CorticAI prevents duplicate planning work and flags conflicts

## Transition Phases

### Phase 1: Manual Baseline (Current State)
**Status**: ✅ Complete (Fixed cosmos storage orphaning manually)
**Achievements**:
- Established proper navigation hierarchy for cosmos storage planning
- Updated CLAUDE.md with explicit navigation requirements
- Created validation framework for measuring CorticAI effectiveness
- Documented the coordination problems CorticAI should solve

**Manual Processes Still Required**:
- Planning document integration into hierarchy
- Navigation link maintenance
- Context discovery assistance
- Coordination failure prevention

### Phase 2: Basic Context Discovery (Early CorticAI)
**Timeline**: Phase 2 development (Progressive Loading System)
**Objective**: CorticAI can help agents find relevant planning documents

**Capabilities to Implement**:
- **Keyword Search**: Find planning documents by topic (e.g., "storage", "cloud", "cosmos")
- **Category Navigation**: Understand planning hierarchy (roadmap → backlog → tasks)
- **Related Document Discovery**: Suggest related planning documents based on current context

**Test Scenario**: Agent working on storage tasks
**Success Criteria**:
- CorticAI surfaces cosmos planning documents when asked about "cloud storage"
- Discovery happens within 30 seconds
- Relevant documents appear in top 3 results

**Manual Processes Remaining**:
- Planning integration still manual
- Navigation relationship maintenance still manual
- Complex conflict detection still manual

### Phase 3: Relationship Intelligence (Lens System)
**Timeline**: Phase 3 development (Lens System)
**Objective**: CorticAI understands planning relationships and suggests integration

**Capabilities to Implement**:
- **Hierarchy Understanding**: Knows parent-child planning relationships
- **Integration Suggestions**: Recommends where new planning should link
- **Completeness Checking**: Identifies missing navigation links
- **Perspective Filtering**: Shows planning relevant to current phase/role

**Test Scenario**: Agent creates new planning document
**Success Criteria**:
- CorticAI suggests appropriate parent planning context
- Recommends navigation links to establish
- Identifies related planning work that should be cross-referenced

**Manual Processes Remaining**:
- Final planning integration decisions still manual
- Complex conflict resolution still requires human judgment

### Phase 4: Active Planning Assistance (Domain Adapters)
**Timeline**: Phase 4 development (Domain Adapters)
**Objective**: CorticAI actively prevents coordination failures

**Capabilities to Implement**:
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies when new planning conflicts with existing work
- **Duplication Prevention**: Warns when planning work already exists
- **Integration Automation**: Automatically suggests specific integration points
- **Template Application**: Applies proper planning structure automatically

**Test Scenario**: Agent proposes storage architecture change
**Success Criteria**:
- CorticAI flags conflict with established cosmos planning
- Suggests reviewing existing ADR-004 and related documents
- Recommends integration approach with existing planning

**Manual Processes Remaining**:
- Strategic planning decisions still require human insight
- Complex architectural trade-offs still need human evaluation

### Phase 5: Proactive Context Management (Extensions)
**Timeline**: Phase 5 development (Extensions)
**Objective**: CorticAI proactively maintains planning context quality

**Capabilities to Implement**:
- **Planning Quality Monitoring**: Detects orphaned nodes, broken links, stale content
- **Maintenance Suggestions**: Recommends planning updates and consolidations
- **Context Enrichment**: Automatically adds relevant cross-references and metadata
- **Agent Onboarding**: Provides context tours for fresh agents

**Test Scenario**: New agent joins project
**Success Criteria**:
- CorticAI provides guided tour of relevant planning context
- Agent quickly understands project status and their role
- No manual onboarding documentation required

**Manual Processes Remaining**:
- Strategic direction setting still requires human leadership
- Major architectural pivots still need human decision-making

### Phase 6: Self-Hosting Success (Scale & Performance)
**Timeline**: Phase 6 development (Scale & Performance)
**Objective**: CorticAI fully manages its own development planning context

**Capabilities to Implement**:
- **Full Automation**: All routine planning integration automated
- **Quality Assurance**: Continuous monitoring of planning context health
- **Strategic Support**: Provides data-driven insights for strategic decisions
- **Knowledge Evolution**: Learns and improves planning patterns over time

**Test Scenario**: CorticAI development continues without manual coordination overhead
**Success Criteria**:
- Zero orphaned planning nodes created
- Navigation always discoverable through proper hierarchy
- Fresh agents onboard without manual context transfer
- Planning quality improves over time through automated maintenance

**Manual Processes Remaining**:
- Only strategic vision and major direction changes require human input

## Validation Metrics by Phase

### Phase 2 Metrics
- **Discovery Success Rate**: >80% of context queries return relevant results
- **Time to Context**: <60 seconds to find relevant planning information
- **Coverage**: Can find all major planning categories (roadmap, backlog, architecture)

### Phase 3 Metrics
- **Relationship Accuracy**: >90% correct parent-child planning relationships identified
- **Integration Suggestions**: >75% of suggested integration points are appropriate
- **Link Completeness**: <5% missing navigation links in planning hierarchy

### Phase 4 Metrics
- **Conflict Detection**: >95% of planning conflicts identified before integration
- **Duplication Prevention**: 0 duplicate planning work created
- **Template Compliance**: >90% of new planning follows established patterns

### Phase 5 Metrics
- **Planning Health**: 0 orphaned nodes, <2% broken links at any time
- **Agent Onboarding**: <30 minutes for new agent to understand project context

## Implementation Strategy

### Technology Requirements by Phase
- **Phase 2**: Basic search and document retrieval
- **Phase 3**: Relationship mapping and graph traversal
- **Phase 4**: Pattern recognition and conflict detection
- **Phase 5**: Automated maintenance and quality monitoring
- **Phase 6**: Machine learning and continuous improvement

### Success Indicators
- **Early Success**: Phase 2-3 tests show clear value over manual processes
- **Momentum Building**: Each phase measurably reduces manual coordination overhead
- **Self-Hosting Achieved**: Phase 6 demonstrates CorticAI can manage complexity at its own scale

### Risk Mitigation
- **Gradual Transition**: Manual processes remain as fallback until automation proves reliable
- **Validation Gates**: Each phase must meet success criteria before advancing
- **Human Oversight**: Strategic decisions remain human-controlled throughout transition

## The Bootstrap Success Scenario

- Planning quality improves through automated maintenance

### Year 3: Self-Hosting (Phase 6)
- CorticAI fully manages its own development complexity
- Meta-coordination overhead eliminated
- System becomes example of its own value proposition
