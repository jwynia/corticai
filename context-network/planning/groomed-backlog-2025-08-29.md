## üöÄ Ready for Implementation

### 1. Build Universal Fallback Adapter
**One-liner**: Create adapter that extracts entities from any text file without configuration
**Effort**: 4-6 hours (Small)
**Files to modify**: 
- Create: `/app/src/adapters/UniversalFallbackAdapter.ts`
- Create: `/app/tests/adapters/universal.test.ts`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Foundation everything else builds on - proves we can extract entities from any file type. This is the first practical validation of our research.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Extracts document structure (headers, paragraphs, lists)
- [ ] Identifies file references and URLs
- [ ] Creates container/content relationships
- [ ] Works with .txt, .md, unknown extensions
- [ ] Returns valid Entity[] structure matching our research patterns

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Create TypeScript interface for Entity based on research patterns
2. Implement text parsing using regex patterns for structure detection
3. Build relationship extraction for references and links
4. Add fallback handling for unknown formats
5. Write comprehensive test suite with various file types

**Watch Out For**: 
- Edge cases with binary files (should gracefully fail)
- Very large files (implement streaming if needed)
- Character encoding issues

**Research Foundation**: `/context-network/research/universal_patterns/domain_adapter_framework.md`

### 2. Create Basic Attribute Index
**One-liner**: Build inverted index for finding entities with shared attributes
**Effort**: 4-5 hours (Small)
**Files to modify**: 
- Create: `/app/src/indexes/AttributeIndex.ts`
- Create: `/app/tests/indexes/attribute-index.test.ts`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Enables the "find all X with Y" queries fundamental to the system. Based on our shared attribute research.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Add/remove attributes for entities
- [ ] Query by single or multiple attributes
- [ ] AND/OR query support
- [ ] Handle 10,000+ entities efficiently
- [ ] Persist index to disk (JSON initially)

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Design attribute storage structure (Map<attribute, Set<entityId>>)
2. Implement add/remove attribute methods
3. Build query engine with boolean logic
4. Add persistence layer
5. Optimize for common query patterns

**Watch Out For**: 
- Memory usage with large datasets
- Query performance degradation
- Concurrent modification issues

**Research Foundation**: `/context-network/research/relationships/shared_attribute_systems.md`

</details>

### 3. Prototype TypeScript Dependency Detection
**One-liner**: Extract and visualize import dependencies from TypeScript files
**Effort**: 6-8 hours (Medium)
**Files to modify**: 
- Create: `/app/src/analyzers/TypeScriptDependencyAnalyzer.ts`
- Create: `/app/tests/analyzers/typescript-deps.test.ts`
- Create: `/context-network/research/findings/dependency-validation.md`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Validates our dependency relationship theory with real code. Critical for proving the system works with programming artifacts.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Parse TypeScript files using compiler API
- [ ] Extract import dependencies
- [ ] Build bidirectional dependency graph
- [ ] Generate simple visualization (console output or basic HTML)
- [ ] Document findings in research folder
- [ ] Handle both relative and package imports

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Set up TypeScript compiler API
2. Parse AST to extract import statements
3. Build graph structure with nodes and edges
4. Implement cycle detection
5. Create basic visualization output
6. Document patterns discovered

**Watch Out For**: 
- Circular dependencies
- Dynamic imports
- Type-only imports vs runtime imports
- Module resolution complexity

**Research Foundation**: `/context-network/research/relationships/dependency_relationship_patterns.md`

## ‚è≥ Ready Soon (Dependencies Clear)

### 4. Build Simple Novel Adapter
**One-liner**: Extract narrative structure and character relationships from text
**Effort**: 5-6 hours (Medium)
**Blocker**: Need Universal Fallback Adapter as base
**Prep work possible**: Review narrative analysis patterns

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Proves the system truly works beyond code - critical validation milestone

**When Ready**:
- After Universal Fallback Adapter is complete
- Can extend base text parsing capabilities

**Implementation Preview**:
- Detect chapters and scenes
- Extract character names (NER or pattern matching)
- Identify locations
- Create character co-occurrence relationships
- Generate timeline

</details>

---

### 5. Cross-Domain Pattern Transfer Experiment
**One-liner**: Validate that patterns learned in one domain apply to others
**Effort**: 3-4 hours (Small)
**Blocker**: Need both TypeScript and Novel adapters
**Prep work possible**: Design experiment protocol

---

## üîß Infrastructure & Integration

### 6. Integrate Kuzu Graph Database
**One-liner**: Set up persistent graph storage for relationships
**Effort**: 8-10 hours (Medium-Large)
**Blocker**: Need entities and relationships to store (tasks 1-3)
**Decision needed**: Schema design for entity storage

---

## üìù Documentation & Setup Tasks (From Sync)

### 7. Document Mastra Integration Patterns
**One-liner**: Create guide for the completed Mastra weather demo
**Effort**: 2-3 hours (Trivial)
**Priority**: Low
**Reason**: Implementation complete but undocumented

---

### 8. Create Project Setup Guide
**One-liner**: Document how to run and develop the project
**Effort**: 2-3 hours (Trivial)
**Priority**: Medium
**Reason**: Basic infrastructure exists but no getting started guide

---

## üóëÔ∏è Archived Tasks (Sync-Confirmed Complete)

### Research Tasks - All Complete ‚úÖ
- ~~Research universal patterns~~ - 3 comprehensive documents created
- ~~Research dependency relationships~~ - 2 detailed analyses complete
- ~~Research memory consolidation~~ - 3 cognitive models documented
- ~~Research refactoring patterns~~ - Completed in research phase

### Infrastructure - Operational ‚úÖ
- ~~Integrate Mastra framework~~ - Weather demo implemented
- ~~Configure OpenRouter~~ - Working with official SDK
- ~~Establish context network structure~~ - Full hierarchy created

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Process Observations & Risks

### Critical Finding: Research Phase Complete, Implementation Stalled
- **Issue**: All research tasks done but zero implementation started
- **Risk**: Project stuck in analysis paralysis
- **Recommendation**: Immediately start Task 1 (Universal Fallback Adapter)

### Alignment Issue: Demo vs Goals
- **Current**: Weather agent demo (working)
- **Intended**: Context processing engine
- **Action**: Either refactor demo or build parallel implementation

---

## Summary Statistics
- Total tasks reviewed: 14
- **Sync-filtered completions**: 6
- **Ready for immediate work**: 3
- **Blocked but clear path**: 3
- **Documentation tasks**: 2
- **Archived**: 6

## Sprint 1 Recommendation (1 Week)

### Week Goal: Prove Core Concepts Work
1. **Day 1-2**: Universal Fallback Adapter (proves entity extraction)
2. **Day 2-3**: Basic Attribute Index (proves querying)
3. **Day 3-5**: TypeScript Dependency Analyzer (proves code domain)

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Can extract entities from any text file
- [ ] Can query entities by attributes
- [ ] Can map TypeScript dependencies
- [ ] All implementations have tests
- [ ] Findings documented in research folder

## Top 3 Actions

1. **START BUILDING** - Begin Universal Fallback Adapter TODAY
2. **Quick Win** - Attribute Index is straightforward, good for momentum
3. **Validate Theory** - TypeScript analyzer will prove/disprove core assumptions

## Next Grooming Trigger
- After completing Sprint 1 (3 tasks)
- Or in 1 week, whichever comes first
- Run `/sync` before next grooming session
