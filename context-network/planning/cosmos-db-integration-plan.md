# Cosmos DB Integration Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan details the implementation of Azure Cosmos DB as a configurable backend for CorticAI, enabling cloud-native deployment while maintaining the dual-role storage architecture and local-first development approach.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established
- **Lifecycle Stage:** Planning
- **Audience:** Developers, Architects

## Strategic Approach

### Design Philosophy
- **Local-First Development**: Full functionality without cloud dependencies
- **Cloud-Native Deployment**: Zero file system dependencies in Azure
- **Seamless Transition**: Same interfaces work in both modes
- **Dual-Role Support**: Cosmos fulfills both Primary and Semantic storage roles

### Integration Strategy
Extend existing storage architecture rather than replace it:
- Build on current `BaseStorageAdapter` pattern
- Implement existing `Storage<T>` and `BatchStorage<T>` interfaces
- Integrate with current `ContextInitializer` environment detection
- Preserve all existing local storage capabilities

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
**Objective**: Establish foundational Cosmos DB adapter and configuration

**Tasks**:
1. **Cosmos Configuration Types**
   - Extend `StorageConfig` types with Cosmos-specific options
   - Add connection string, database, and container configurations
   - Include performance tuning parameters (RU/s, consistency levels)

2. **CosmosDBStorageAdapter Base Implementation**
   - Extend `BaseStorageAdapter<T>` for consistency with existing pattern
   - Implement `Storage<T>` and `BatchStorage<T>` interfaces
   - Handle connection management and retry logic

## Technical Specifications

### Document Schema Design

**Primary Storage Documents (Graph Role)**:
```typescript
// Node Document
{
  id: string,                    // Partition key
  docType: 'node',
  entityType: string,
  properties: Record<string, any>,
  metadata: {
    created: string,
    updated: string,
    source: string
  },
  relationships: {               // Denormalized for fast traversal
    outgoing: string[],
    incoming: string[],
    paths: Record<string, string[]>
  }
}

// Edge Document
{
  id: string,
  docType: 'edge',
  relationshipType: string,      // Partition key
  from: { id: string, type: string },
  to: { id: string, type: string },
  properties: Record<string, any>,
  metadata: object
}
```

**Semantic Storage Documents (Analytics Role)**:
```typescript
// Materialized View Document
{
  id: string,
  docType: 'view',
  viewType: string,              // Partition key
  data: any,                     // Computed view data
  metadata: {
    lastUpdated: string,
    sourceQuery: string,
    refreshInterval: number
  }
}

// Search Index Document
{
  id: string,
  docType: 'searchIndex',
  sourceId: string,
  content: string,               // Full-text searchable
  keywords: string[],
  metadata: object
}
```

### Performance Characteristics

**Request Unit (RU) Optimization**:
- Point reads: 1 RU per document
- Query operations: 3-100+ RUs depending on complexity
- Batch operations: Optimized for bulk processing
- Cross-partition queries: Higher RU consumption, use sparingly

**Partitioning Strategy**:
- Primary Storage: Partition by entity type for balanced distribution
- Semantic Storage: Partition by view type for query optimization
- Episode data: Partition by time ranges for efficient archival

**Indexing Policy**:
- Include all searchable properties
- Exclude large binary data and embeddings
- Composite indexes for multi-property queries
- Vector indexes for semantic search capabilities

## Implementation Notes

This plan is designed to be executed incrementally through the regular backlog grooming process. Each phase can be broken down into individual tasks that can be prioritized and scheduled independently. The phased approach ensures that progress can be made incrementally while maintaining system stability throughout the implementation process.
