## Critical Path

The critical path represents the longest sequence of dependent tasks that determines the minimum project duration:

```
1.1 Environment Setup (4h)
→ 1.2 Database Setup (6h)
→ 3.1 Graph Schema (6h)
→ 3.2 Graph Data Layer (10h)
→ 3.3 Graph Builder (12h)
→ 5.1 Basic Queries (8h)
→ 6.1 CLI Interface (6h)
→ 7.2 Integration Tests (8h)

Total Critical Path: 60 hours
```

## Parallel Execution Opportunities

### Track A: Parsing Pipeline

- 2.1 Tree-sitter Integration (8h)
- 2.2 AST Processing (12h)
- 2.3 File System Scanner (6h)
Total: 26 hours

### Track B: Storage Pipeline
Depends on Database Setup:
- 3.1 Graph Schema (6h)
- 3.2 Graph Data Layer (10h)
- 3.3 Graph Builder (12h)
Total: 28 hours

### Track C: Memory Pipeline
Can run in parallel after Environment Setup:
- 4.1 Hot Cache (6h)
- 4.2 Three-Tier Coordination (10h)
Total: 16 hours

### Track D: Testing Pipeline
Runs continuously alongside development:

## Dependency Risk Analysis

### High-Risk Dependencies

1. **Graph Builder (3.3)**
   - Depends on: AST Processing, Graph Data Layer, File Scanner
   - Risk: Integration complexity
   - Mitigation: Early prototyping, clear interfaces

2. **Three-Tier Coordination (4.2)**
   - Depends on: Hot Cache, Graph Data Layer
   - Risk: State management complexity
   - Mitigation: Simple initial implementation

3. **Query Implementation (5.1)**
   - Depends on: Graph Data Layer
   - Risk: Performance requirements
   - Mitigation: Start with basic queries, optimize later

### Circular Dependencies
None identified - architecture is acyclic.

### External Dependencies

| Dependency | Required By | Risk Level | Mitigation |
|------------|-------------|------------|------------|
| tree-sitter | Task 2.1 | Low | Well-maintained library |
| KuzuDB | Task 1.2 | Medium | Fallback to Neo4j |
| Node.js 18+ | Task 1.1 | Low | Widely available |
| TypeScript | Task 1.1 | Low | Standard tool |

## Optimization Opportunities

### Fast Track Options
If resources allow parallel development:
1. **Two developers**: One on Parsing (Track A), one on Storage (Track B)
2. **Three developers**: Add Memory track (Track C) in parallel
3. **Continuous testing**: Dedicated test writing throughout

### Sequential Optimization
If single developer:
1. Focus on critical path first
2. Defer optimization tasks (5.2)
3. Implement minimal viable features
4. Add enhancements in phase 2

### Milestone 4: User Interface (Day 9)
- ✓ CLI commands working
- ✓ API documented
- ✓ Error handling complete

### Milestone 5: Production Ready (Day 10)

- ✓ Documentation complete

## Dependency Management Strategy

### Daily Sync Points
- Morning: Check dependency status
- Midday: Resolve blockers
- Evening: Update progress

### Dependency Tracking
- Use project board for task status
- Flag blocked tasks immediately
- Document interface contracts early
- Test integration points frequently

### Risk Mitigation
- Start high-dependency tasks early
- Build interfaces before implementations
- Create mocks for parallel development
- Have fallback plans for external dependencies

## Conclusion

The dependency structure allows for significant parallelization, potentially reducing the timeline from 126 sequential hours to approximately 80-90 hours with parallel execution. The critical path of 60 hours represents the absolute minimum duration, achievable with optimal resource allocation and no delays.
