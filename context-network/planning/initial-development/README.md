# Initial Development Planning - CorticAI Context Network

## Overview
This planning package defines the initial development tasks for implementing the CorticAI context network system, based on comprehensive research validating our approach with 50+ academic papers and industry best practices.

## Planning Scope
The initial development phase focuses on establishing the foundational architecture that all future development will build upon. This includes the core memory system, basic graph storage, and essential parsing infrastructure.

## Success Criteria
- Foundation supports all planned features
- Architecture is modular and extensible
- Core systems are testable in isolation
- Performance meets initial benchmarks
- Risk mitigation strategies are in place

## Planning Documents

1. **[Problem Definition](problem-definition.md)** - What we're solving and why
2. **[Requirements](requirements.md)** - Functional and non-functional requirements
3. **[Task Breakdown](task-breakdown.md)** - Detailed task decomposition
4. **[Dependencies](dependencies.md)** - Task dependency graph and sequencing
5. **[Risk Assessment](risk-assessment.md)** - Identified risks and mitigations
6. **[Readiness Checklist](readiness-checklist.md)** - Pre-implementation validation

## Timeline Estimate
- **Duration**: 2 weeks (Phase 1 of 10-week plan)
- **Team Size**: 1-2 developers
- **Complexity**: Medium-High

## Key Decisions
- Start with KuzuDB for graph storage (18-64x faster ingestion)
- Use tree-sitter for parsing (incremental, error-recovery)
- Implement three-tier memory from the start
- Build modular architecture for easy extension

## Next Steps
1. Review all planning documents
2. Validate requirements with stakeholders
3. Ensure development environment is ready
4. Begin with Task 1: Environment Setup
