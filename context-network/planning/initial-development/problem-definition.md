# Problem Definition - Initial Development Tasks

## Core Problem Statement

We need to build a context network system that addresses the fundamental challenge of **context fragmentation** across software development tools and domains. Current tools operate in silos, leading to:

- Lost context when switching between tools
- Inability to leverage cross-domain patterns
- Repeated work due to poor knowledge retention
- Inefficient knowledge transfer between projects

## Why This Matters

### Developer Productivity Impact
- Developers spend 35% of time searching for information
- Context switching costs 23 minutes per interruption
- Knowledge re-discovery happens multiple times per project
- Cross-project learning is manual and error-prone

### System Integration Challenges
- No unified representation across code, docs, tests
- Dependency relationships are opaque
- Pattern recognition happens manually
- Knowledge decays without consolidation

## Stakeholders

### Primary Users
- **Software Developers**: Need fast code navigation and understanding
- **Technical Leads**: Require architectural visibility
- **New Team Members**: Need rapid onboarding

### System Integrators
- **IDE/Editor Developers**: Need semantic intelligence
- **DevOps Teams**: Require dependency understanding
- **Documentation Systems**: Need knowledge extraction

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success
- ✅ Parse and index TypeScript codebases
- ✅ Build dependency graphs automatically
- ✅ Extract semantic patterns across files
- ✅ Provide sub-100ms navigation queries
- ✅ Support incremental updates

### Performance Success
- ✅ Index 1000+ files in <60 seconds
- ✅ Query responses in <100ms (P95)
- ✅ Memory usage <2GB for 10K files
- ✅ Support real-time parsing

### Quality Success
- ✅ 95%+ accuracy in dependency detection
- ✅ Zero data corruption
- ✅ Graceful error recovery
- ✅ Clear error messages

## Problem Boundaries

### In Scope for Initial Development
- TypeScript/JavaScript parsing
- Local file system support
- Basic dependency analysis
- Memory-based caching
- Graph-based storage
- Simple query interface

### Out of Scope (Future Phases)
- Multi-language support
- Distributed processing
- LLM integration
- Advanced pattern mining
- Cross-domain alignment
- Production deployment

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Tools Limitations
| Tool | Strength | Limitation |
|------|----------|------------|
| LSP | Semantic analysis | No persistence |
| tree-sitter | Fast parsing | No semantics |
| CodeQL | Deep analysis | Slow, complex |
| IDEs | Integration | Tool-specific |

### Our Differentiation
- **Persistent Knowledge**: Three-tier memory system
- **Cross-Domain**: Universal pattern extraction
- **Fast + Deep**: tree-sitter speed with LSP depth
- **Evolutionary**: Offline consolidation and learning

## Problem Validation

### Research Validation
- ✅ 50+ papers confirm approach viability
- ✅ Neuroscience validates memory model
- ✅ Industry trends support graph-based systems
- ✅ Performance benchmarks favor our tech choices

### Market Validation
- Growing demand for code intelligence
- Shift toward graph-based knowledge systems
- Need for cross-tool integration
- Requirement for persistent context

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints
- Must work on commodity hardware
- Cannot require cloud services initially
- Must integrate with existing tools
- Should support incremental adoption

### Assumptions
- Users have TypeScript projects
- File system access is available
- Graph database can be installed
- Node.js runtime is present

## Problem Decomposition

### Core Challenges to Solve

1. **Parsing Challenge**
   - Fast incremental parsing
   - Error recovery
   - Multi-file coordination

2. **Storage Challenge**
   - Efficient graph operations
   - Memory management
   - Persistence strategy

3. **Analysis Challenge**
   - Dependency detection
   - Pattern extraction
   - Semantic understanding

4. **Query Challenge**
   - Fast navigation
   - Complex queries
   - Result ranking

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- Parsing speed: >1000 lines/second
- Query latency: <100ms P95
- Memory efficiency: <100MB per 1000 files
- Accuracy: >95% dependency detection

### Qualitative Metrics
- Developer satisfaction
- Ease of integration
- Code quality improvement
- Knowledge retention increase

## Risk Factors

### Technical Risks
- Graph database scalability
- Memory consumption growth
- Parser accuracy limitations
- Integration complexity

### Adoption Risks
- Learning curve
- Setup complexity
- Performance expectations
- Migration effort

## Conclusion

The initial development phase must establish a solid foundation that:
1. Proves the core concept works
2. Delivers immediate value
3. Supports future extensions
4. Minimizes technical debt

By focusing on TypeScript parsing, graph storage, and basic analysis, we can validate our approach while building toward the full vision of a universal context network system.
