# CorticAI Project Roadmap

## Purpose
This document outlines the development path for CorticAI, structured by phase dependencies rather than dates. Each phase builds on previous capabilities to create a comprehensive context engine.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Dynamic

### Technical Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Database performance at scale | High | Incremental indexing, lazy loading, caching |
| Memory usage for large projects | Medium | Three-tier memory architecture, consolidation |
| Query response times | Medium | Materialized views, query optimization |
| Complexity of dual databases | Low | Clear separation of concerns, good abstractions |

### Success Indicators

**Phase 1 Success:**
