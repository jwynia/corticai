### Technical Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Database performance at scale | High | Incremental indexing, lazy loading, caching |
| Memory usage for large projects | Medium | Three-tier memory architecture, consolidation |
| Query response times | Medium | Materialized views, query optimization |
| Complexity of dual databases | Low | Clear separation of concerns, good abstractions |

### Success Indicators

**Phase 1 Success:**
- Basic storage and retrieval working

- Cross-domain patterns detected

**Phase 3 Success:**
- No more duplicate file creation
- Context automatically maintained

**Phase 4 Success:**

- Historical insights available

## Technical Debt & Risk Management

### Identified Technical Debt
1. **Nested Property Queries**: Kuzu may struggle with deep JSON nesting (High Priority)
2. **Error Handling**: Need consistent error types across adapters (Medium Priority)
3. **Test Coverage**: Integration tests for complex queries needed (Medium Priority)
4. **Type Safety**: Runtime validation for domain types missing (Low Priority)

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Kuzu performance with nested JSON | High | Test early, implement fallbacks |
| Memory usage at scale | High | Progressive loading (Phase 2) |
| Lens complexity confusion | Medium | Start simple, good defaults |
| Over-abstraction | Medium | Validate with real use cases |
