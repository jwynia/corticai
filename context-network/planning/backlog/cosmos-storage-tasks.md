# Cosmos DB Storage Integration - Task Breakdown

## Overview

This document breaks down the **Phase 7: Cloud Storage Architecture** implementation into discrete, sequenced tasks suitable for backlog grooming and sprint planning. Each task is designed to be independently deliverable while building toward the complete dual-role storage architecture.

**Parent Planning Context:**
- **Phase**: Phase 7 of the CorticAI roadmap (after Phase 5 completion)
- **Parent Documents**: [[roadmap]], [[backlog]], [[planning/index]]
- **Architecture Foundation**: [[dual-role-storage-architecture]], [[cosmos-db-integration-plan]]
- **Strategic Context**: Enable cloud-native deployment while preserving local-first development

**Decision Point**: This work begins when Phase 5 extensions are complete and production deployment requirements emerge.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established
- **Lifecycle Stage:** Planning
- **Audience:** Developers, Scrum Masters
