# CorticAI Implementation Phases

## Purpose
This document defines the implementation phases for CorticAI, structured by dependencies rather than timelines. Each phase builds on previous capabilities to enable increasingly sophisticated features.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation follows a dependency-driven sequence where each phase enables the next. The system is designed for incremental development with value delivery at each phase.

**IMPORTANT**: Each phase includes integrated research tasks that validate approaches before full implementation. These research tasks are first-class work items, not separate activities.

## Phase 1: Core Engine [Foundation]

### Goals
- Establish storage infrastructure
- Implement basic operations
- Create minimal API

### Components
- **Storage Setup**: Initialize Kuzu graph database and DuckDB analytics
- **File Monitoring**: Watch for file changes in project
- **Basic API**: CRUD operations for nodes and edges
- **Simple Queries**: Basic pattern matching

### Key Technologies
- Kuzu for graph storage
- DuckDB for analytics
- Chokidar for file watching
- TypeScript for type safety

### Completion Criteria
- Storage initialized and accessible
- File changes detected and logged
- Basic CRUD operations working
- Simple queries returning results

### Enables
- All subsequent phases require this foundation

## Phase 2: Domain Support

- Cross-domain insights discovered

### Enables
- Full system vision realized
- Continuous improvement through learning

## Implementation Approach

### For Each Phase

1. **Design First**
   - Document detailed specifications
   - Create interface definitions
   - Design test scenarios

2. **Build Core**
   - Implement minimal functionality
   - Write comprehensive tests
   - Create basic documentation

3. **Iterate and Refine**
   - Test with real projects
   - Gather usage patterns
   - Optimize performance

4. **Integration**
   - Connect with other components
   - Ensure compatibility
   - Update documentation

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**: Component-level functionality
**Integration Tests**: Cross-component interactions
**Performance Tests**: Scalability and speed
**User Acceptance**: Real-world usage patterns

### Risk Mitigation

**Technical Risks**
- Database performance at scale
- Memory usage for large projects
- Query response times

**Mitigation Strategies**
- Incremental indexing
- Lazy loading patterns
- Caching frequently accessed data
