# CorticAI Validation Cases

## Overview

This document defines specific validation cases where CorticAI must prove its core value proposition by solving the exact problems it's designed to address. These cases serve as both test scenarios and demonstration of CorticAI's effectiveness.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established
- **Lifecycle Stage:** Planning
- **Audience:** Architects, Developers, Stakeholders

## The Bootstrap Challenge

CorticAI is designed to solve meta-level coordination problems:
- **Context Discovery**: Helping agents find all relevant prior work
- **Navigation Intelligence**: Making obvious what detail exists at deeper levels
- **Amnesia Prevention**: Stopping agents from creating contradictory work
- **Relationship Tracking**: Preventing orphaned nodes and missing connections

The validation challenge: **Can CorticAI solve these problems for its own development?**

## Primary Validation Case: Cosmos Storage Planning Integration

### The Problem We Solved Manually
During Phase 7 planning (Cloud Storage Architecture), we experienced exactly the coordination failure CorticAI is designed to prevent:

1. **Orphaned Planning Nodes**: Created detailed task breakdown without proper parent context
2. **Navigation Gaps**: Fresh agents couldn't discover cosmos planning work through normal hierarchy
3. **Missing Integration**: New planning wasn't linked into existing roadmap/backlog structure
4. **Context Fragmentation**: Related architectural decisions existed in isolation

### Manual Solution Applied
- Updated planning index to reference cosmos storage as discoverable "Future Phase"
- Added Phase 7 to main backlog with clear scope and prerequisite signals
- Updated roadmap to include Phase 7 with proper dependency chain
- Added parent context to task breakdown with navigation links
- Updated CLAUDE.md with explicit navigation requirements

### CorticAI Validation Criteria

**Test Scenario**: A fresh agent starts work on storage-related tasks in Phase 5 or later.

**Success Criteria**:
1. **Context Discovery**: CorticAI automatically surfaces existing cosmos planning work
2. **Conflict Prevention**: Warns agent if new storage work conflicts with planned cosmos architecture
3. **Navigation Intelligence**: Suggests appropriate planning detail level based on current phase
4. **Integration Assistance**: Prompts agent to consider cloud deployment implications
5. **Amnesia Prevention**: Detects if agent starts duplicate cosmos planning work

**Implementation Timeline**:
- **Phase 2-3**: Basic context discovery working (can find planning documents by keyword)
- **Phase 4**: Relationship tracking working (understands planning hierarchy)
- **Phase 5**: Intelligence layer working (makes recommendations about related work)
- **Phase 7**: Full validation (CorticAI manages its own planning context)

### Validation Procedure

#### Phase 2-3 Validation: Basic Discovery
**Test**: Fresh agent searches for "storage architecture" or "cloud deployment"
**Expected**: CorticAI returns cosmos planning documents in ranked results
**Metrics**: Cosmos planning appears in top 3 results

#### Phase 4 Validation: Hierarchy Understanding
**Test**: Agent examines Phase 5 tasks, asks about storage implications
**Expected**: CorticAI explains Phase 7 dependency and cosmos architecture approach
**Metrics**: Correct parent-child planning relationships understood

#### Phase 5 Validation: Intelligent Recommendations
**Test**: Agent proposes new storage adapter or database integration
**Expected**: CorticAI suggests reviewing cosmos planning, highlights potential conflicts
**Metrics**: Relevant cosmos planning surfaced without explicit request

#### Phase 7 Validation: Self-Hosting Success
**Test**: CorticAI manages its own development planning
**Expected**: New planning work automatically integrates into proper hierarchy
**Metrics**: Zero orphaned planning nodes, navigation always discoverable

## Secondary Validation Cases

### 2. Code Refactoring Coordination
**Problem**: Multiple agents working on related code changes without coordination
**Test**: Parallel refactoring of storage layer components
**Success**: CorticAI prevents conflicting changes, suggests coordination

### 3. Architecture Decision Consistency
**Problem**: New architectural decisions contradicting existing patterns
**Test**: Propose storage technology that conflicts with dual-role architecture
**Success**: CorticAI flags conflict with established ADR-004

### 4. Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition
**Problem**: Recreating patterns that exist in other domains
**Test**: Implement file watching in new domain adapter
**Success**: CorticAI suggests existing patterns from other adapters

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 2: Foundation Testing
- Implement basic context search and discovery
- Test against cosmos planning scenario
- Measure discovery accuracy and relevance

### Phase 3: Relationship Mapping
- Build planning hierarchy understanding
- Test parent-child navigation recommendations
- Validate planning context suggestions

### Phase 4: Intelligence Layer
- Implement conflict detection and recommendations
- Test against multiple validation scenarios
- Measure recommendation quality and accuracy

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Validation
- Full testing against all validation cases
- Measure prevention of coordination failures
- Document success/failure patterns

### Phase 7: Self-Hosting Validation
- CorticAI manages its own planning context
- Validation by absence of manual coordination issues
- Long-term observation of planning quality

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Discovery Accuracy**: >90% relevant results in top 3 for context queries
- **Conflict Prevention**: 0 major coordination failures during development
- **Navigation Efficiency**: <30 seconds to find relevant planning detail
- **Planning Quality**: 0 orphaned planning nodes after Phase 5

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Agent Experience**: Fresh agents can quickly understand project context
- **Coordination Reduction**: Less manual planning integration required
- **Decision Quality**: Better architectural decisions due to complete context
- **Knowledge Retention**: Context persists across agent sessions

## Risk Mitigation

### If Validation Fails
- **Partial Success**: CorticAI provides value even if not perfect
- **Manual Fallback**: Maintain manual coordination processes as backup
- **Iterative Improvement**: Learn from failures to improve system
- **Scope Reduction**: Focus on highest-value coordination problems first

### Success Indicators
- **Early Warning**: Phase 2-3 discovery tests show promise
- **Progressive Improvement**: Each phase shows measurable gains
- **User Adoption**: Agents naturally rely on CorticAI recommendations
- **Self-Hosting Success**: CorticAI manages its own complexity
