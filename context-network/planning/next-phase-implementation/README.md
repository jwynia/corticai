# Next Phase Implementation Planning

## Purpose
Comprehensive planning for the next development phase following the successful completion of Phase 1 Core Engine, Progressive Loading System, and Lens System Foundation.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Tactical
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Planning Context

### Current Achievement State (What We Just Accomplished)
- ✅ **Phase 1 Core Engine**: Universal Context Engine foundation (15,000+ lines, 800+ tests)
- ✅ **Phase 2 Progressive Loading**: 5-depth system with 80% memory reduction
- ✅ **Phase 3 Lens Foundation**: Complete lens architecture with activation detection
- ✅ **First Domain Solution**: NovelAdapter proving cross-domain versatility
- ✅ **Production Quality**: Comprehensive security, performance monitoring, test coverage

### Strategic Context: From Foundation to User Value
We have successfully built the **universal context engine foundation**. The next phase must shift from proving concepts to **delivering user-facing value** that demonstrates CorticAI's practical intelligence.

### Key Strategic Questions Addressed
1. **How do we prove system versatility?** → Build diverse domain adapters
2. **How do we deliver user-facing intelligence?** → Implement concrete lens implementations
3. **How do we ensure production readiness?** → Focus on performance and integration
4. **How do we validate the architecture?** → Real-world usage patterns and optimization

  - [task-breakdown.md](./task-breakdown.md) - Detailed implementation tasks

## Planning Deliverables

### Core Planning Documents
- **Problem Definition**: Clear articulation of what we're building next and why
- **Architecture Strategy**: Technical approach and integration patterns
- **Task Breakdown**: Groom-ready implementation tasks with acceptance criteria
- **Risk Assessment**: Technical and integration risks with mitigation strategies
- **Success Metrics**: How we'll know we've succeeded

### Integration Requirements
- **Grooming Compatibility**: Tasks formatted for `/groom` command processing
- **Implementation Readiness**: Clear acceptance criteria for test-driven development
- **Architecture Alignment**: Builds on existing foundation without breaking changes
- **User Value Focus**: Each deliverable provides tangible user benefit

## Key Planning Principles

### Strategic Focus: User-Facing Value
This phase transitions from "proving it works" to "making it useful" - every deliverable must provide direct user value while strengthening the architectural foundation.

### Implementation Strategy: Parallel Value Streams
1. **Domain Versatility** (CodebaseAdapter, DocumentationAdapter)
2. **Intelligence Features** (DebugLens, DocumentationLens)
3. **Production Quality** (Performance optimization, integration polish)

### Quality Gates: Production Readiness
All implementations must meet production-quality standards established in Phase 1:
- >90% test coverage
- Comprehensive error handling
- Performance benchmarking
- Security validation
- Integration testing
