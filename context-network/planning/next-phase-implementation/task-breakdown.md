# Task Breakdown: Next Phase Implementation

## Task Organization Strategy

### Parallel Development Streams
Tasks are organized into three parallel streams that can be developed simultaneously:

1. **Stream A: Domain Adapters** (CodebaseAdapter, DocumentationAdapter)
2. **Stream B: Lens Implementations** (DebugLens, DocumentationLens)
3. **Stream C: Integration & Polish** (Performance optimization, integration testing)

Each task is formatted for direct processing by the `/groom` command and ready for test-driven implementation.
