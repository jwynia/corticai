# Query Interface Layer - Problem Definition

## Problem Statement

The CorticAI system has multiple storage adapters (Memory, JSON, DuckDB) each with different query capabilities. Currently, there's no unified way to query data across these adapters, limiting the system's ability to:

1. Perform complex data retrieval operations consistently
2. Optimize queries based on storage backend capabilities
3. Provide a user-friendly query API for developers
4. Enable cross-adapter data operations

## Why This Matters

### Business Impact
- **Developer Productivity**: Developers need to learn different query patterns for each adapter
- **Feature Limitations**: Complex queries are only possible with DuckDB, limiting use cases
- **Performance Issues**: No query optimization means inefficient data retrieval
- **Maintenance Burden**: Query logic scattered across codebase

### Technical Impact
- **Code Duplication**: Similar query logic reimplemented for each adapter
- **Type Safety**: No consistent type-safe query mechanism
- **Scalability**: Linear scan performance for non-indexed queries
- **Testing Complexity**: Different test strategies for each adapter

## Stakeholders

### Primary Users
- **Application Developers**: Need simple, powerful query API
- **Data Scientists**: Require complex aggregation and analysis capabilities
- **System Integrators**: Need consistent behavior across storage backends

### System Components
- **Storage Adapters**: Must implement query execution
- **AttributeIndex**: Can leverage advanced query capabilities
- **Entity System**: Consumes query results
- **Future Analytics**: Will build on query interface

## Current Limitations

### Functional Limitations
1. **No Unified Query Language**: Each adapter has different capabilities
2. **Limited Operations**: Only basic get/set/delete available consistently
3. **No Aggregations**: Sum, count, avg only in DuckDB
4. **No Sorting**: Manual implementation required
5. **No Pagination**: Must load all data then slice
6. **No Joins**: Cannot correlate data across collections

### Performance Limitations
1. **Full Scans**: Memory/JSON adapters scan all data
2. **No Query Planning**: Queries execute as written
3. **No Caching**: Results recalculated every time
4. **No Indexes**: Beyond basic key lookup
5. **Memory Pressure**: Large result sets loaded entirely

### Developer Experience
1. **Inconsistent APIs**: Different methods per adapter
2. **No Query Builder**: String concatenation for SQL
3. **Limited Type Safety**: Query results loosely typed
4. **Poor Error Messages**: Generic storage errors
5. **No Query Debugging**: Can't inspect execution plan

## Success Criteria

The Query Interface Layer successfully solves the problem when:

### Functional Success
- [ ] All adapters support consistent query operations
- [ ] Complex queries work across all backends
- [ ] Query results are properly typed
- [ ] Errors are clear and actionable

### Performance Success
- [ ] Indexed queries achieve O(log n) or better
- [ ] Query planning reduces execution time by 30%+
- [ ] Result caching eliminates redundant computation
- [ ] Memory usage stays bounded for large results

### Developer Success
- [ ] Single query API to learn
- [ ] Type-safe query construction
- [ ] Clear documentation and examples
- [ ] Helpful error messages
- [ ] Query debugging capabilities

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with Storage<T> interface
- Cannot break existing adapter implementations
- Must work with TypeScript's type system
- Should not require external dependencies

### Resource Constraints
- Implementation timeframe: 2-3 sprints
- Must not significantly increase bundle size
- Performance overhead < 10% for simple queries
- Memory overhead < 20% for query metadata

### Operational Constraints
- Must support gradual rollout
- Cannot require data migration
- Must handle adapter capability differences gracefully
- Should provide migration path from direct adapter usage

## Assumptions

### Validated Assumptions
- Storage adapters follow consistent patterns ✓
- TypeScript provides sufficient type safety ✓
- Current test infrastructure is adequate ✓

### Assumptions to Validate
- Query optimization provides meaningful performance gains
- Developers prefer builder pattern over string DSL
- Caching provides significant benefits
- Index hints improve query planning

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly NOT part of this effort:
- Creating new storage adapters
- Modifying existing storage adapter interfaces
- Implementing full SQL compatibility
- Building visual query builder UI
- Real-time query subscriptions
- Distributed query execution
- Query result streaming
