# Query Interface Layer - Risk Assessment

## Risk Register

### Technical Risks

#### RISK-1: Performance Degradation

- User complaints about slow queries

**Mitigation**:
- Implement comprehensive benchmarking early
- Design for zero-cost abstractions where possible
- Provide escape hatch for direct adapter access
- Use lazy evaluation and streaming

**Contingency**:
- Optimize hot paths
- Add caching layer
- Allow bypass for performance-critical operations

---

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Risk Score**: 4/9

**Indicators**:
- Type errors in consumer code
- Need for excessive type assertions
- Runtime type mismatches

**Mitigation**:
- Prototype type system early

- Memory usage grows unbounded
- System becomes unresponsive

**Mitigation**:
- Implement streaming from the start
- Set memory limits
- Use pagination by default
- Memory profiling in tests

**Contingency**:
- Emergency memory limits
- Automatic result truncation
- Disk-based overflow
- Query complexity limits

### Implementation Risks

#### RISK-5: Scope Creep
**Description**: Feature requests expand scope beyond planned implementation

**Probability**: High
**Impact**: Medium
**Risk Score**: 6/9

**Indicators**:
- New requirements after development starts
- Pressure to add "just one more feature"
- Timeline extensions

**Mitigation**:
- Clear scope documentation
- Phased delivery plan
- Stakeholder sign-off on requirements
- Change control process

**Contingency**:
- Defer to next phase
- Time-boxed implementation
- Feature flags for experimental features

---

#### RISK-6: Breaking Changes
**Description**: Query interface changes break existing code using storage adapters

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Very High
**Risk Score**: 4/9

**Indicators**:
- Existing tests fail
- Consumer code breaks
- Migration required

**Mitigation**:
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Deprecation warnings
- Comprehensive testing
- Beta release period

**Contingency**:
- Version both interfaces
- Migration tools
- Compatibility layer
- Rollback plan

---

#### RISK-7: Testing Complexity
**Description**: Query combinations create exponential test cases, making comprehensive testing impossible

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium
**Risk Score**: 4/9

**Indicators**:
- Test suite becomes unmaintainable
- Edge cases discovered in production
- Test execution time excessive

**Mitigation**:
- Property-based testing
- Test matrix generation
- Focus on critical paths
- Fuzz testing

**Contingency**:
- Risk-based testing
- Production monitoring
- Quick patch process

### Operational Risks

#### RISK-8: Learning Curve
**Description**: Developers struggle to understand and use the query interface effectively

**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Low
**Risk Score**: 2/9

**Indicators**:
- Many support questions
- Incorrect usage patterns
- Preference for direct adapter access

**Mitigation**:
- Intuitive API design
- Comprehensive documentation
- Code examples
- IDE support (IntelliSense)

**Contingency**:
- Training sessions
- Query builder UI
- Support channels
- Simplified API subset

---

#### RISK-9: Performance Monitoring Gap
**Description**: Cannot effectively monitor and optimize query performance in production

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Medium
**Risk Score**: 2/9

**Indicators**:
- Slow queries go unnoticed
- Cannot identify bottlenecks
- No performance metrics

**Mitigation**:
- Built-in performance metrics
- Query logging
- Execution plan output
- Integration with APM tools

**Contingency**:
- Add monitoring post-release
- Manual performance audits
- User reporting

### Security Risks

#### RISK-10: Query Injection
**Description**: Improperly sanitized queries lead to data exposure or corruption

**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Very High
**Risk Score**: 4/9

**Indicators**:
- Security audit findings
- Unexpected query behavior
- Data breaches

**Mitigation**:
- Parameterized queries only
- Input validation
- Security testing
- Code review focus on security

**Contingency**:
- Security patches
- Incident response plan
- Audit logging
- Rollback capability
