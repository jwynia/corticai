# Retrospectives Index

## Purpose
This directory contains retrospective analyses after significant tasks or milestones, capturing learnings, decisions, and context network updates.

## Retrospectives

### 2025-01-14: Universal Context Engine Roadmap Planning
**File**: `2025-01-14-roadmap-planning.md`
**Key Outcomes**:
- Created 14-week implementation roadmap
- Discovered existing foundation is solid
- Confirmed no architectural limitations
- Established dual-database architecture plan

**Major Decisions**:
- Add Kuzu alongside DuckDB (not replace)
- Use Mastra agents for intelligence layer
- Maintain flexible schema approach

**Critical Learning**: Always verify current implementation state before planning major architectural changes.

## Best Practices

1. **Conduct retrospectives immediately** after significant tasks
2. **Focus on learnings** not just outcomes
3. **Document decisions** and their rationale
4. **Update context network** based on findings
5. **Identify patterns** across retrospectives

## Patterns Observed Across Retrospectives

### Common Themes
- Existing code often more complete than expected
- Flexible foundations enable major features
- Separation of concerns consistently pays off
- Clear roadmaps prevent wasted effort

### Recurring Recommendations
- Verify assumptions before planning
- Document decisions as they're made
- Create explicit dependency chains
- Maintain bidirectional relationships
