# Retrospectives Index

## Purpose
This directory contains retrospective analyses after significant tasks or milestones, capturing learnings, decisions, and context network updates.

## Retrospectives

### 2025-09-24: Progressive Loading System Implementation
**File**: `2025-09-24-progressive-loading-system.md`
**Key Outcomes**:
- Complete Progressive Loading System with 5 depth levels
- 40 comprehensive tests with 80% memory reduction validation
- QueryBuilder depth integration with immutable pattern
- Code and test quality reviews (B+ ratings)

**Major Decisions**:
- Enum-based depth levels for numeric comparisons
- Dual entity structure support (structured + flat)
- Automatic performance hints generation
- Immutable builder with state preservation

**Critical Learning**: Test-driven development with comprehensive upfront test suites dramatically improves implementation quality and catches edge cases early.

### 2025-01-14: Universal Context Engine Roadmap Planning
**File**: `2025-01-14-roadmap-planning.md`
**Key Outcomes**:
- Created 14-week implementation roadmap
- Discovered existing foundation is solid
- Confirmed no architectural limitations
- Established dual-database architecture plan

**Major Decisions**:
- Add Kuzu alongside DuckDB (not replace)
- Use Mastra agents for intelligence layer
- Maintain flexible schema approach

**Critical Learning**: Always verify current implementation state before planning major architectural changes.

## Best Practices

1. **Conduct retrospectives immediately** after significant tasks
2. **Focus on learnings** not just outcomes
3. **Document decisions** and their rationale
4. **Update context network** based on findings
5. **Identify patterns** across retrospectives

## Patterns Observed Across Retrospectives

### Common Themes
- Existing code often more complete than expected
- Flexible foundations enable major features
- Separation of concerns consistently pays off
- Clear roadmaps prevent wasted effort
- Test-driven development accelerates quality implementation
- Interface contracts must be carefully aligned between tests and implementation

### Recurring Recommendations
- Verify assumptions before planning
- Document decisions as they're made
- Create explicit dependency chains
- Maintain bidirectional relationships
- Write comprehensive tests before implementation
- Include performance validation in test suites
- Use immutable patterns for complex builders
