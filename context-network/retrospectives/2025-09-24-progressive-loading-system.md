## Task Summary

**Objective**: Implement a Progressive Loading System with test-driven development to enable memory-efficient context retrieval with 5 depth levels (SIGNATURE through HISTORICAL).

**Outcome**: Complete implementation delivered with comprehensive test coverage, achieving all design goals:
- ✅ Complete Progressive Loading System (450 lines in `src/types/context.ts`)
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite (637 lines across 2 files, 40 tests passing)
- ✅ QueryBuilder depth integration with immutable builder pattern
- ✅ Performance validation achieving 80% memory reduction at SIGNATURE depth
- ✅ Code quality review (B+ rating, 85/100)
- ✅ Test quality review (B+ rating, 85/100)

**Key Learning**: Test-driven development with pre-written comprehensive test suites accelerates implementation while ensuring quality, but requires careful attention to interface contracts between tests and implementation.

## Context Network Updates

### Discovery Records Created

#### 2025-09-24-001: QueryBuilder Immutability Pattern
**Found**: `app/src/query/QueryBuilder.ts:45-67`
**Summary**: QueryBuilder uses immutable builder pattern but lacked proper state preservation helper
**Significance**: Critical for maintaining depth through method chaining
**Solution**: Added `createNew()` helper method to preserve all state when creating new instances

#### 2025-09-24-002: Entity Projection Complexity
**Found**: `app/src/types/context.ts:181-244`
**Summary**: Entity projection must handle both structured (DepthAwareEntity) and flat entity formats
**Significance**: Enables progressive loading across different entity storage patterns
**Implementation**: Dual-path projection logic with automatic structure detection

#### 2025-09-24-003: Performance Hints Generation
**Found**: `app/src/query/QueryBuilder.ts:89-120`
**Summary**: Depth-aware queries generate performance optimization metadata automatically
**Significance**: Enables storage adapters to optimize based on depth requirements
**Pattern**: Metadata calculation based on depth characteristics and estimated memory factors

### New Architectural Patterns Discovered

#### Immutable Builder State Preservation
```typescript
// Pattern for maintaining state through immutable operations
private createNew(updates: Partial<QueryBuilder<T>['state']>): QueryBuilder<T> {
  return new QueryBuilder({
    ...this.state,
    ...updates
  })
}
```

#### Dual-Structure Entity Projection
```typescript
// Pattern for handling multiple entity structures
const isStructured = entity.signature && entity.structure && entity.semantic && entity.detailed && entity.historical
if (isStructured) {
  // Handle structured DepthAwareEntity
  for (const field of projection.includedFields) {
    if (['id', 'type', 'name'].includes(field)) {
      result[field] = entity.signature?.[field] || entity[field]
    }
    // ... depth-specific field extraction
  }
} else {
  // Handle flat entities with direct property access
  for (const field of projection.includedFields) {
    if (entity.hasOwnProperty(field)) {
      result[field] = entity[field]
    }
  }
}
```

### Integration Discovery: Query Interface Layer Connection

**Critical Finding**: This Progressive Loading System implements the depth-aware querying capability planned in `context-network/planning/query-interface/architecture-design.md`.

**Connection Points**:
- QueryBuilder now has `withDepth()` method as planned in architecture design
- Query interface includes `depth` and `performanceHints` fields
- Performance optimization hints align with planned adapter capability system
- Entity projection enables memory-efficient loading as envisioned

**Implications**: The Progressive Loading System serves as the foundation for the broader Query Interface Layer performance optimization strategy.

## Identified Gaps and Updates (Grouped by Priority)

### Critical Updates Required

#### Update Query Interface Planning
**Reason**: Progressive Loading System implementation revealed specific depth integration points not captured in planning
**Files**: `context-network/planning/query-interface/architecture-design.md`
**Update**: Add section on depth-aware query execution and performance hints system

#### Document Progressive Loading Architecture Decision
**Reason**: Major architectural component implemented without formal decision record
**Location**: `context-network/decisions/`
**Content**: Rationale for 5-level depth system, enum-based approach, performance optimization strategy

### Important Updates

#### Create Progressive Loading Implementation Guide
**Reason**: Complex system needs implementation documentation for future storage adapter integration
**Location**: `context-network/implementation/progressive-loading/`
**Content**: Integration patterns, entity structure requirements, performance characteristics

#### Update Storage Adapter Capability Framework
**Reason**: Storage adapters need to support depth-aware loading
**Files**: Query interface planning documents
**Update**: Add depth awareness to adapter capabilities specification

### Nice-to-Have Updates

#### Performance Benchmarking Results Documentation
**Reason**: 80% memory reduction claim needs detailed benchmarking documentation
**Location**: `context-network/research/performance/`
**Content**: Benchmark methodology, results across different entity sizes, scaling characteristics

## Decisions Made During Implementation

### ADR-001: Enum-Based Depth Levels
**Decision**: Use numeric enum (1-5) instead of string constants for depth levels
**Rationale**: Enables numeric comparison operations (`depth < ContextDepth.SEMANTIC`)
**Alternatives Considered**: String constants, object-based levels
**Consequences**: More efficient comparison, less readable than strings
**Status**: Implemented

### ADR-002: Immutable Builder Pattern with State Preservation
**Decision**: Maintain strict immutability while preserving all state through operations
**Rationale**: Prevents depth loss during query construction, ensures thread safety
**Implementation**: `createNew()` helper method with state spreading
**Consequences**: Slightly more complex implementation, much safer usage patterns
**Status**: Implemented

### ADR-003: Dual Entity Structure Support
**Decision**: Support both structured (DepthAwareEntity) and flat entity formats
**Rationale**: Enables progressive loading across different storage patterns without migration
**Trade-off**: More complex projection logic vs. broader compatibility
**Status**: Implemented

### ADR-004: Performance Hints Integration
**Decision**: Automatically generate performance optimization hints with depth-aware queries
**Rationale**: Enables storage adapters to optimize without manual configuration
**Implementation**: Memory factor calculation, optimized field identification
**Status**: Implemented
