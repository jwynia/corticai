# Storage Abstraction: Initial Structure Created

## Completion Date
2025-09-09

## Overview
Successfully created the initial directory structure and test files for the storage abstraction implementation, following TDD principles as outlined in the context network planning documents.

## What Was Completed

### Directory Structure Created
- `/workspaces/corticai/app/src/storage/` - Root storage source directory
- `/workspaces/corticai/app/src/storage/adapters/` - Storage adapter implementations
- `/workspaces/corticai/app/src/storage/interfaces/` - Interface definitions
- `/workspaces/corticai/app/tests/storage/` - Root storage test directory  
- `/workspaces/corticai/app/tests/storage/adapters/` - Adapter test files

### Initial Test Files Created (TDD First)
- `/workspaces/corticai/app/tests/storage/storage.interface.test.ts` - Core interface tests
- `/workspaces/corticai/app/tests/storage/adapters/json.adapter.test.ts` - JSON adapter tests
- `/workspaces/corticai/app/tests/storage/adapters/memory.adapter.test.ts` - Memory adapter tests

### Initial Source Files Created (Empty Placeholders)
- `/workspaces/corticai/app/src/storage/interfaces/Storage.ts` - Core interface definitions
- `/workspaces/corticai/app/src/storage/adapters/JSONStorageAdapter.ts` - JSON storage implementation
- `/workspaces/corticai/app/src/storage/adapters/MemoryStorageAdapter.ts` - Memory storage implementation
- `/workspaces/corticai/app/src/storage/index.ts` - Main exports file

## Testing Status
- All new test files created and passing (with placeholder tests)
- All existing tests continue to pass (107/107 tests passing)
- No breaking changes introduced
- Ready for Stage 1 TDD implementation

## Alignment with Context Network Planning

This work directly implements the requested structure from:
- `context-network/planning/storage-abstraction/README.md` - Overall strategy
- `context-network/planning/storage-abstraction/task-sequence.md` - Implementation stages
- `context-network/planning/storage-abstraction/interface-design.md` - Interface specifications

### Stage Mapping
- **Stage 1**: Interface Definition - Files created, ready for TDD implementation
- **Stage 2**: JSON & Memory Adapters - Test files ready for TDD development
- Future stages can build upon this foundation

## Next Steps

The structure is now ready for Stage 1 TDD development:

1. **Task 1.1**: Implement core Storage interface in `Storage.ts`
2. **Task 1.2**: Add QueryableStorage interface
3. **Task 1.3**: Add TransactionalStorage interface

Then proceed to Stage 2:
1. **Task 2.1**: Implement JSONStorageAdapter
2. **Task 2.2**: Refactor AttributeIndex to use adapter
3. **Task 2.3**: Implement MemoryStorageAdapter

## File Paths Reference

All file paths are absolute as required:
- Source: `/workspaces/corticai/app/src/storage/`
- Tests: `/workspaces/corticai/app/tests/storage/`

## Design Principles Followed

1. **TDD First**: Created tests before implementation code
2. **Interface-First Design**: Structure supports progressive interface development  
3. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between interfaces and adapters
4. **Backward Compatibility**: No changes to existing code, all tests pass
5. **Context Network Alignment**: Structure matches planning documents exactly
