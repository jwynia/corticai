# Assess and Document Actual Current Development Phase

## Task Definition
**Type**: Strategic Planning
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium (45-60 minutes)
**Dependencies**: Team discussion, architectural understanding

## Context
Sync report reveals project is ~2 phases ahead of documented status. Planning documents show outdated phase progression that doesn't match implementation reality. Need strategic assessment of actual current state.

## Original Recommendation
"Assess and document actual current development phase"

## Why Deferred
- Requires strategic decision-making
- Needs team alignment on priorities
- Should validate completion criteria for current phase
- Impacts roadmap and resource allocation
- Requires careful phase transition planning

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Review actual implementation completeness of Phases 1-3
- [ ] Assess Phase 4 (Domain Adapters) progress
- [ ] Determine if Phase 5 (Extensions) is current priority
- [ ] Update `planning/roadmap.md` with reality-based phases
- [ ] Document phase transition criteria
- [ ] Update milestone tracking
- [ ] Validate next phase readiness

## Current State Analysis Needed
1. **Phase 4 Assessment**:
   - NovelAdapter complete âœ…
   - CodebaseAdapter status?
   - PlaceDomainAdapter still needed?
   - Adapter framework completeness?

2. **Phase 5 Readiness**:
   - Pattern detection requirements
   - External integration priorities
   - Performance optimization needs
   - Production readiness criteria

3. **Strategic Priorities**:
   - User-facing value delivery
   - Technical debt management
   - Cloud deployment preparation (Phase 7)

## Decision Points
- Are we in Phase 4, 5, or transitioning?
- What defines "phase completion"?
- Should we skip ahead to higher-value phases?
- How do we prevent further documentation drift?

## Implementation Approach
1. **Current State Audit** (15 min):
   - List all implemented features
   - Map to original phase definitions
   - Identify gaps vs. completions

2. **Strategic Assessment** (20 min):
   - Evaluate business value priorities
   - Consider technical readiness
   - Review dependency chains

3. **Documentation Update** (20 min):
   - Update roadmap with reality
   - Adjust phase definitions if needed
   - Set clear completion criteria

## Estimated Effort
- Current state audit: 15 minutes
- Strategic assessment: 20 minutes
- Documentation updates: 20 minutes
- Validation/review: 10 minutes
- **Total**: ~65 minutes

## Related Tasks
- Update roadmap based on reality (follow-up)
- Implement sync automation process
- Architecture documentation updates

## Discussion Required
- Team consensus on current phase
- Priority alignment for next work
- Resource allocation decisions
