# Task: Convert Test File Operations to Async

## Status: TODO

## Priority: Low

## Created: 2025-01-29

## Original Recommendation
Test file uses synchronous file operations and execSync which can be slower and block the event loop. Consider using async operations for better performance.

## Why Deferred
- Effort: Medium (requires rewriting multiple test functions)
- Risk: Medium (changing test infrastructure)
- Dependencies: Requires converting all test functions to async
- Current tests work correctly and pass
- Performance impact is minimal for test suite

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Convert all `readFileSync` calls to use `fs/promises` `readFile`
- [ ] Convert test functions to async where needed
- [ ] Replace `execSync` with async exec from `child_process/promises`
- [ ] Ensure all tests still pass after conversion
- [ ] Maintain test readability and structure

## Implementation Notes

### Current Code Pattern
```typescript
const packageJson = JSON.parse(readFileSync(packageJsonPath, 'utf-8'));
const result = execSync('npm run build', { ... });
```

### Target Pattern
```typescript
import { readFile } from 'fs/promises';
import { exec } from 'child_process/promises';

const packageJson = JSON.parse(await readFile(packageJsonPath, 'utf-8'));
const result = await exec('npm run build', { ... });
```

## Benefits
- Non-blocking I/O in tests
- Better performance for large test suites
- Consistent with async patterns in main code
- Enables parallel test execution

## Estimated Effort
- Size: Medium
- Complexity: Low
- Time: 30-60 minutes

## Dependencies
- None - isolated to test files

## Risks
- Test complexity may increase slightly
- Need to ensure proper async/await usage
- May need to update test timeouts

## Testing
- Run full test suite after conversion
- Verify no race conditions introduced
- Check test execution time before/after

## Notes
This is a good improvement but not critical since:
1. Current tests pass reliably
2. Test performance is acceptable
3. Synchronous operations in tests are common practice
4. Risk of introducing bugs during conversion

Consider this task when:
- Test suite becomes slow
- Adding more file-heavy tests
- Doing general test refactoring
