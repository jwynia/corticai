# Task: Refactor DuckDBStorageAdapter to Reduce File Size

## Context
The DuckDBStorageAdapter file is currently 609 lines, exceeding the recommended 500 line limit. This affects maintainability and readability.

## Original Recommendation
From code review on 2025-09-09:
- File is too long and handles multiple concerns
- Should be split into focused modules

## Requirements

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Main adapter file reduced to < 400 lines
- [ ] Extracted components maintain single responsibility
- [ ] All tests still pass
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API
- [ ] Type safety maintained

### Suggested Refactoring

1. **Extract DuckDBConnectionManager class**
   - Move connection pooling logic
   - Handle database instance creation
   - Manage connection lifecycle
   - ~100 lines

2. **Extract DuckDBQueryBuilder class**
   - SQL query construction
   - Parameter binding logic
   - Type conversion utilities
   - ~150 lines

3. **Extract DuckDBTypeConverter class**
   - BigInt handling
   - JSON serialization/deserialization
   - Type mapping between JS and DuckDB
   - ~80 lines

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: Large (2-3 hours)
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Risk**: Medium (needs careful testing)

## Dependencies
- Requires understanding of current architecture
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Tests must be updated to reflect new structure

## Technical Notes
- Use dependency injection for extracted components
- Maintain current error handling patterns
- Preserve debug logging capability
- Consider using factory pattern for component creation

## Benefits
- Improved maintainability
- Better testability (can unit test components)
- Clearer separation of concerns
- Easier to add new features

## Priority
**Medium** - Not blocking functionality but important for long-term maintenance
