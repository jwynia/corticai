# Extract Complex Nested Logic Into Separate Methods

## Task Definition
**Type**: Refactoring
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Small to Medium (30-60 minutes)
**Dependencies**: Understanding of path traversal logic

## Context
The path traversal logic in KuzuStorageAdapter contains deep nesting that makes it harder to read, test, and maintain. Extracting this into separate, focused methods will improve code clarity.

## Original Recommendation
"Extract path validation logic into separate methods from KuzuStorageAdapter.ts:700-730"

## Why Deferred
- Requires understanding of graph traversal algorithm
- Need to preserve complex logic behavior exactly
- Should add unit tests for extracted methods
- May affect performance if not done carefully

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify logical boundaries within nested path traversal code
- [ ] Extract path validation logic into focused methods
- [ ] Extract edge matching logic into separate method
- [ ] Add unit tests for extracted methods
- [ ] Ensure existing integration tests still pass
- [ ] Improve code readability without changing behavior

## Target Code Location
**File**: `src/storage/adapters/KuzuStorageAdapter.ts:700-730`
**Current issues**:
- Deep nesting (4+ levels)
- Complex conditional logic mixed with iteration
- Single method handling multiple responsibilities

## Suggested Refactoring
**Extract methods**:
1. `validateGraphPath(path, pattern)` - Path structure validation
2. `matchesEdgeTypes(edges, expectedTypes)` - Edge type matching
3. `buildGraphPathResult(path)` - Result object construction
4. `filterPathsByPattern(paths, pattern)` - Pattern-based filtering

## Implementation Notes
**Before**:
```typescript
// Large nested method with multiple responsibilities
async traverse(pattern) {
  // ... 50+ lines of nested logic
  for (path of paths) {
    if (condition1) {
      if (condition2) {
        if (condition3) {
          // deep nested logic
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**After**:
```typescript
async traverse(pattern) {
  const paths = await this.executeTraversalQuery(pattern)
  return this.filterValidPaths(paths, pattern)
}

private filterValidPaths(paths, pattern) {
  return paths.filter(path => this.isValidPath(path, pattern))
}

private isValidPath(path, pattern) {
  return this.validateGraphPath(path) && this.matchesEdgeTypes(path, pattern)
}
```

## Estimated Effort
- Analysis and planning: 15 minutes
- Method extraction: 30 minutes
- Test creation: 30 minutes
- Validation: 15 minutes
- **Total**: ~90 minutes

## Benefits
- Improved readability and maintainability
- Better testability with focused unit tests
- Easier debugging and error handling
- Reduced cognitive complexity

## Risk Mitigation
- Preserve exact behavior with comprehensive tests
- Extract one method at a time
- Use descriptive method names
- Add documentation for complex algorithms
