# Task: Extract Complex Aggregation Logic into Separate Module

## Priority
Medium

## Source
Code review recommendation - 2025-09-10

## Problem Statement
The aggregation implementation in MemoryQueryExecutor.ts (lines 450-750) has deep nesting (4+ levels) and complex logic that would benefit from being extracted into a dedicated AggregationProcessor class.

## Current State
- Complex aggregation logic embedded in MemoryQueryExecutor
- Deep nesting making code hard to follow
- Mixing of concerns (aggregation, grouping, having)
- Difficult to test in isolation

## Proposed Solution

### Create AggregationProcessor
```typescript
export class AggregationProcessor<T> {
  // Handle all aggregation operations
  processAggregations(
    data: T[], 
    aggregations: Aggregation<T>[]
  ): AggregationResult[]
  
  // Handle grouping + aggregations
  processGroupByAggregations(
    data: T[],
    groupBy: GroupBy<T>,
    aggregations: Aggregation<T>[]
  ): GroupedAggregationResult[]
  
  // Apply having clause
  applyHavingClause(
    results: GroupedAggregationResult[],
    having: HavingCondition
  ): GroupedAggregationResult[]
}
```

### Benefits of Extraction
- Single responsibility principle
- Easier unit testing
- Reduced complexity in main executor
- Potential reuse in other executors
- Better performance optimization opportunities

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AggregationProcessor handles all aggregation logic
- [ ] MemoryQueryExecutor delegates to processor
- [ ] All aggregation tests still pass
- [ ] Performance unchanged or improved
- [ ] Clear interface and documentation
- [ ] Support for custom aggregation functions

## Implementation Details

### Aggregation Types to Support
- count, count_distinct
- sum, avg, min, max
- median, percentile (future)
- Custom aggregations

### Optimization Opportunities
- Lazy evaluation
- Streaming aggregations for large datasets
- Parallel processing for independent aggregations
- Index-aware aggregations

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: Medium-Large (6-8 hours)
**Complexity**: High
**Risk**: Medium (core functionality)

## Implementation Notes
1. Start with simple aggregations (count, sum)
2. Add complex aggregations incrementally
3. Ensure proper null handling
4. Optimize for common cases
5. Consider memory efficiency for large datasets

## Dependencies
- Comprehensive test coverage for aggregations
- No breaking changes to public API

## Testing Strategy
1. Extract with existing tests passing
2. Add focused unit tests for processor
3. Test edge cases (empty data, nulls)
4. Performance benchmarks
5. Memory usage tests for large datasets

## Future Enhancements
- Support for window functions
- Incremental aggregation updates
- Distributed aggregation support
- Custom aggregation registration
