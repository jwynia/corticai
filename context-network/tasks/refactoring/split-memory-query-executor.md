# Task: Split MemoryQueryExecutor into Smaller Modules

## Priority
Medium

## Source
Code review recommendation - 2025-09-10

## Problem Statement
MemoryQueryExecutor.ts is 838 lines, exceeding the recommended 500 line limit. The file contains multiple responsibilities that could be better organized into separate modules for improved maintainability.

## Current State
- Single large file handling:
  - Filtering logic
  - Sorting logic  
  - Aggregation logic
  - Grouping logic
  - Projection logic
  - Having clause logic
  - Helper functions

## Proposed Solution

### Create Separate Processors
```
/app/src/query/executors/processors/
├── FilterProcessor.ts      (~150 lines)
├── SortProcessor.ts        (~100 lines)
├── AggregationProcessor.ts (~200 lines)
├── GroupingProcessor.ts    (~150 lines)
├── ProjectionProcessor.ts  (~50 lines)
└── index.ts
```

### Refactored MemoryQueryExecutor Structure
```typescript
export class MemoryQueryExecutor<T> {
  private filterProcessor: FilterProcessor<T>
  private sortProcessor: SortProcessor<T>
  private aggregationProcessor: AggregationProcessor<T>
  // ... other processors
  
  execute(query: Query<T>, data: T[]): QueryResult<T> {
    // Orchestrate processors
  }
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] MemoryQueryExecutor reduced to < 200 lines (orchestration only)
- [ ] Each processor in its own focused module
- [ ] All existing tests still pass
- [ ] No performance regression
- [ ] Clear interfaces between processors
- [ ] Documentation for each processor

## Benefits
- Improved maintainability
- Easier testing of individual components
- Better code organization
- Simplified debugging
- Potential for reuse in other executors

## Effort Estimate
**Size**: Medium (4-6 hours)
**Complexity**: Medium
**Risk**: Low (with comprehensive test coverage)

## Implementation Notes
1. Start by extracting one processor at a time
2. Run tests after each extraction
3. Keep public API of MemoryQueryExecutor unchanged
4. Consider using composition pattern
5. Ensure proper TypeScript types throughout

## Dependencies
- Existing test suite must be comprehensive
- No breaking changes to public API

## Testing Strategy
1. Ensure all existing tests pass
2. Add unit tests for each processor
3. Verify integration between processors
4. Performance benchmark before/after
