# Task: Split Large Implementation Files

## Priority: Medium

## Context
During code review, several implementation files were identified as exceeding recommended size limits (500-600 lines), making them harder to maintain and understand.

## Files Requiring Refactoring

### 1. DuckDBStorageAdapter.ts (884 lines)
**Current Structure**: Monolithic class containing all functionality
**Proposed Split**:
- `DuckDBStorageAdapter.ts` - Main adapter class (~300 lines)
- `DuckDBMutexManager.ts` - Mutex/synchronization logic (~150 lines)
- `DuckDBTableManager.ts` - Table creation and validation (~150 lines)
- `DuckDBQueryBuilder.ts` - SQL generation utilities (~200 lines)
- `DuckDBConstants.ts` - All constants and configuration (~50 lines)

### 2. QueryBuilder.ts (813 lines)
**Current Structure**: Single class with all query building methods
**Proposed Split**:
- `QueryBuilder.ts` - Core builder class (~300 lines)
- `ConditionBuilder.ts` - Simple condition builders (~200 lines)
- `CompositeConditionBuilder.ts` - AND/OR/NOT logic (~150 lines)
- `QueryValidator.ts` - Validation logic (~100 lines)
- `QueryTypes.ts` - Type definitions (if not already separate)

### 3. MemoryQueryExecutor.ts (616 lines)
**Current Structure**: All query execution logic in one file
**Proposed Split**:
- `MemoryQueryExecutor.ts` - Main executor (~200 lines)
- `processors/FilterProcessor.ts` - Filtering logic (~150 lines)
- `processors/SortProcessor.ts` - Sorting logic (~100 lines)
- `processors/GroupingProcessor.ts` - GROUP BY logic (~150 lines)
- Note: Aggregation already extracted to AggregationUtils

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Each file stays under 500 lines
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] No public API changes
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Proper imports/exports maintained
- [ ] Performance characteristics unchanged

## Implementation Approach
1. Start with the smallest refactoring (MemoryQueryExecutor)
2. Create processor modules one at a time
3. Move to QueryBuilder splitting
4. Finally tackle DuckDBStorageAdapter (most complex)

## Effort Estimate
- **Total**: 4-6 hours
- **Per File**: 1-2 hours
- **Risk**: Medium (need careful testing)

## Dependencies
- Comprehensive test coverage (already exists)
- Understanding of current architecture (documented)

## Benefits
- Improved maintainability
- Easier to understand and modify
- Better code organization
- Enables parallel development
- Reduces cognitive load

## Testing Strategy
1. Ensure 100% test pass rate before starting
2. Refactor incrementally with tests running
3. Use IDE refactoring tools where possible
4. Benchmark performance before/after
