# Task: Refactor AttributeIndex to Reduce File Size

## Priority: Medium

## Context
The AttributeIndex.ts file currently exceeds 500 lines (511 lines), which impacts maintainability. This was identified during code review as a medium priority issue.

## Original Recommendation
"File exceeds 500 lines - Consider extracting serialization logic to a separate class or module to improve maintainability"

## Why Deferred
- Requires careful architectural planning
- Medium risk due to moving core functionality
- Needs to maintain backward compatibility
- All tests must continue passing

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] AttributeIndex.ts reduced to under 400 lines
- [ ] Serialization logic extracted to separate module
- [ ] All existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API
- [ ] Performance remains unchanged or improves

## Technical Approach
1. Create new `AttributeIndexSerializer.ts` module
2. Extract save/load methods and related helpers
3. Extract serialization format logic
4. Consider extracting query operators to separate module
5. Maintain clean interfaces between modules

## Effort Estimate
- **Development**: 2-3 hours
- **Testing**: 1 hour
- **Total**: Medium (3-4 hours)

## Dependencies
- Must maintain compatibility with existing persisted indexes
- Should coordinate with any ongoing work on graph database migration

## Success Metrics
- File size reduced by at least 20%
- No performance degradation
- Code coverage maintained or improved
- Clearer separation of concerns

## Related Items
- Graph database migration planning
- Overall architecture review

## Notes
- Consider using the Strategy pattern for different serialization formats
- This refactoring could make future graph DB integration easier
- Good opportunity to add more comprehensive serialization tests
