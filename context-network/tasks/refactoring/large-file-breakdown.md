# Break Down Large Files Into Focused Modules

## Task Definition
**Type**: Refactoring
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Large (2+ hours)
**Dependencies**: Team planning, architecture review

## Context
Several core files exceed the recommended 500-line limit, making them harder to maintain, test, and understand. Breaking them into smaller, focused modules will improve code organization and maintainability.

## Original Recommendation
"Break down large files (1000+ lines) into smaller, focused modules using composition"

## Why Deferred
- Large refactoring effort requiring careful planning
- Risk of introducing bugs during decomposition
- Needs architectural review to determine optimal boundaries
- Requires comprehensive test coverage validation
- May impact multiple dependent files

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Plan module boundaries for each large file
- [ ] Ensure existing test coverage is preserved
- [ ] Break files into logical, single-responsibility modules
- [ ] Update imports across dependent files
- [ ] Validate all tests pass after refactoring
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect new structure

## Files to Address

### KuzuStorageAdapter.ts (1,113 lines)
**Suggested breakdown**:
- Query builder/executor
- Connection management
- Graph operations
- Storage interface implementation

### ContinuityCortex.ts (937 lines)
**Suggested breakdown**:
- Core orchestrator
- Event handling
- Metrics and monitoring
- Configuration management

### QueryBuilder.ts (872 lines)
**Suggested breakdown**:
- Query construction
- Validation logic
- Type-specific builders
- Query optimization

### CodebaseAdapter.ts (855 lines)
**Suggested breakdown**:
- Code structure extraction
- Relationship detection
- Language-specific parsers
- Entity creation

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Choose one file to refactor as proof of concept
2. **Phase 2**: Create comprehensive tests for chosen file
3. **Phase 3**: Design module boundaries
4. **Phase 4**: Extract modules one at a time
5. **Phase 5**: Update all imports and dependencies
6. **Phase 6**: Validate and repeat for other files

## Estimated Effort
- Planning per file: 30 minutes
- Implementation per file: 2-4 hours
- Testing and validation: 1-2 hours per file
- **Total for all files**: 12-20 hours

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with least critical file
- Maintain extensive test coverage
- Use feature flags if needed
- Incremental approach with frequent testing

## Related Tasks
- Test coverage improvement
- Documentation updates
- Import dependency analysis
