# Environment Setup Task - Completed

## Task: Development Environment Setup (Task 1.1)

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

### Date: 2025-01-29

## Summary

Successfully implemented a complete TypeScript development environment for the CorticAI Core package following Test-Driven Development principles.

## What Was Implemented

### Project Structure
- Created `/packages/corticai-core/` package structure
- Set up TypeScript project with modern tooling
- Configured for ES modules with Node.js 18+ support

### Build System
- **tsx** for development with hot reload
- **esbuild** for production builds (7ms build time!)
- TypeScript declaration generation
- Path aliases configured (@/*)

### Testing Framework
- **Vitest** configured with coverage support
- Test-first approach with 21 comprehensive tests
- All tests passing (100% success rate)
- Coverage reporting configured

### Code Quality Tools
- **ESLint** with TypeScript rules
- **Prettier** for consistent formatting
- **Husky** for git hooks
- **lint-staged** for pre-commit checks
- Type checking with strict mode

## Test-Driven Development Process

### Tests Written First ✅
1. Wrote comprehensive environment setup tests (21 tests total)
2. Verified tests failed initially (RED phase)
3. Implemented minimal code to pass tests (GREEN phase)
4. Refactored and cleaned up code (REFACTOR phase)

### Test Coverage
- Project structure tests: 5 tests
- Build configuration tests: 4 tests
- Testing framework tests: 3 tests
- Linting/formatting tests: 5 tests
- Additional configuration tests: 4 tests

## Validation Results

### All Success Criteria Met
- ✅ Project builds successfully (7ms with esbuild)
- ✅ Tests run and pass (21/21 passing)
- ✅ Linting works (ESLint configured and passing)
- ✅ Git hooks configured (Husky + lint-staged)

### Quality Gates Passed
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ Linting passes with no errors
- ✅ Type checking passes
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Code formatted with Prettier

## Files Created

### Configuration Files
- `package.json` - Project configuration with all scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with strict mode
- `vitest.config.ts` - Test runner configuration
- `.eslintrc.json` - Linting rules
- `.prettierrc` - Code formatting rules
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore patterns
- `.env.example` - Environment variable template

### Source Files
- `src/index.ts` - Main entry point with CorticAI class
- `__tests__/environment-setup.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

### Documentation
- `README.md` - Package documentation with usage examples

### Git Hooks
- `.husky/pre-commit` - Pre-commit hook for lint-staged

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Modern Tooling**: Used tsx instead of ts-node for better performance
2. **Fast Builds**: esbuild for production builds (7ms!)
3. **Test-First**: All tests written before implementation
4. **Strict TypeScript**: Enabled all strict checks for type safety
5. **ES Modules**: Configured as ESM package for modern JavaScript

## Performance Metrics

- Build time: **7ms** (esbuild)
- Test execution: **1.5s** for 21 tests
- Type checking: **<1s**
- Linting: **<1s**

## Next Steps

With the environment setup complete, the next tasks are:
1. Task 1.2: Database Installation and Setup (KuzuDB)
2. Task 2.1: Tree-sitter Integration
3. Task 3.1: Graph Schema Design

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test-first works**: Writing tests first clarified requirements
2. **Modern tools matter**: tsx and esbuild significantly improve DX
3. **Configuration is critical**: Proper setup saves time later
4. **Quality gates help**: Automated checks catch issues early

## Dependencies Installed

### Production Dependencies
- kuzu: ^0.6.0 (Graph database)
- tree-sitter: ^0.21.1 (Parser)
- tree-sitter-typescript: ^0.23.0 (TypeScript grammar)

### Development Dependencies
- TypeScript toolchain
- Testing framework (Vitest)
- Linting and formatting tools
- Build tools (esbuild, tsx)

## Confidence Level: HIGH

The environment is fully set up, tested, and ready for the next phase of development. All tools are working correctly, and the foundation is solid for building the CorticAI context network system.
