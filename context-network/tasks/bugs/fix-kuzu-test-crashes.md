# Task: Fix KuzuStorageAdapter Test Suite Crashes

## Priority: HIGH ðŸŸ 

## Context
Kuzu tests are causing worker process crashes, forcing entire test suite to be skipped.

## Current Issue
- Tests crash with "Channel closed" error
- Entire test suite skipped: `describe.skip('KuzuStorageAdapter')`
- No test coverage for critical graph functionality

## Symptoms
```
Error: Channel closed
  at target.send node:internal/child_process:753:16
  at ProcessWorker.send node_modules/tinypool/dist/index.js:140:41
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify root cause of process crashes
- [ ] Fix compatibility with test runner
- [ ] Re-enable all Kuzu tests
- [ ] Ensure 100% test stability
- [ ] Document any special test requirements

## Investigation Steps
1. Check Kuzu native library compatibility with Node.js workers
2. Test with different pool strategies (forks, threads, vmThreads)
3. Consider isolated test runner for native modules
4. Check for memory/resource leaks
5. Verify cleanup in afterEach hooks

## Potential Solutions
- Run Kuzu tests in separate process
- Use different test runner for native modules
- Upgrade Kuzu library version
- Implement proper resource cleanup
- Add test timeouts and retries

## Effort Estimate
**Large** (1-2 days)
- Complex debugging
- May require architecture changes
- Testing different solutions

## Risk
**High** - No test coverage for graph database
