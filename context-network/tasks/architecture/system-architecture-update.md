# Update System Architecture Documentation

## Task Definition
**Type**: Architecture Documentation
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Large (60+ minutes)
**Dependencies**: System-wide architectural knowledge

## Context
Sync report found that Phases 2-3 are complete but system architecture documentation doesn't reflect progressive loading and lens system integration points. This creates architectural blind spots.

## Original Recommendation
"Update architecture documentation to reflect progressive loading and lens system integration points"

## Why Deferred
- Large effort requiring comprehensive review
- Needs understanding of component relationships
- Requires architectural diagrams/updates
- Should validate integration patterns
- Impacts multiple architecture documents

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Update `architecture/system_architecture.md` with progressive loading
- [ ] Document lens system integration in `architecture/component_map.md`
- [ ] Update `architecture/data_architecture.md` with depth-aware queries
- [ ] Reflect new components in `architecture/integration_patterns.md`
- [ ] Create/update architectural diagrams
- [ ] Document performance implications
- [ ] Update cross-references

## Implementation Notes
Focus areas:
1. **Progressive Loading Integration**:
   - How ContextDepth affects query execution
   - Memory management implications
   - Performance characteristics at each depth

2. **Lens System Architecture**:
   - Query modification pipeline
   - Lens composition patterns
   - Registry and activation system

3. **Domain Adapter Framework**:
   - NovelAdapter as proof-of-concept
   - Adapter composition patterns
   - Cross-domain validation approach

## Dependencies
- Complete discovery records first (see related task)
- Review actual implementation details
- Understand performance benchmarks

## Estimated Effort
- System architecture review: 30 minutes
- Component map updates: 20 minutes
- Data architecture updates: 15 minutes
- Integration patterns: 15 minutes
- Documentation review/linking: 10 minutes
- **Total**: ~90 minutes

## Related Tasks
- Create discovery records (prerequisite)
- Update roadmap based on reality
- Document current development phase
