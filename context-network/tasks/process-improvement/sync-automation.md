# Implement Sync Automation Process

## Task Definition
**Type**: Process Improvement
**Priority**: Medium
**Effort**: Large (60+ minutes)
**Dependencies**: Tooling knowledge, process design

## Context
Sync report identified systematic documentation lag (~15-20 commits behind reality). Manual sync every time development gets ahead is unsustainable. Need automated triggers and processes.

## Original Recommendation
"Implement sync automation: Run `/sync` after every 5-10 commits"

## Why Deferred
- Large effort requiring process design
- Needs tooling/automation implementation
- Should integrate with existing workflows
- Requires testing and validation
- Impacts development workflow

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design automated sync trigger system
- [ ] Implement commit-based sync automation
- [ ] Create planning update checklist for major features
- [ ] Add documentation review to code review process
- [ ] Test automation with recent commits
- [ ] Document new process for team
- [ ] Create monitoring/alerting for drift

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Git Hook Based
- Pre-commit or post-commit hooks
- Trigger sync after N commits
- Auto-create documentation PRs

### Option 2: CI/CD Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Trigger on significant commits
- Generate documentation updates

### Option 3: Manual Process Enhancement
- Checklist integration
- Code review requirements
- Planning update templates

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Identify significant commits (feat:, major refactors)
- [ ] Parse commit messages for component changes
- [ ] Auto-detect completion patterns
- [ ] Generate update suggestions
- [ ] Integrate with context network structure

## Process Design Needed
1. **Trigger Conditions**:
   - Feature completion commits
   - Major refactoring
   - New component addition
   - Test suite expansions

2. **Automated Actions**:
   - Run drift detection
   - Generate update suggestions
   - Create planning document PRs
   - Alert on major discrepancies

3. **Manual Review Gates**:
   - Validate automated findings
   - Approve planning updates
   - Resolve ambiguous cases

## Estimated Effort
- Process design: 20 minutes
- Automation implementation: 40 minutes
- Testing and validation: 30 minutes
- Documentation: 15 minutes
- **Total**: ~105 minutes
