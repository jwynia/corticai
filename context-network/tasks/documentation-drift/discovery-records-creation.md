# Create Comprehensive Discovery Records

## Task Definition
**Type**: Documentation
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium (30-60 minutes)
**Dependencies**: Implementation discovery

## Context
Sync report identified that major implementations (Progressive Loading, Lens System, NovelAdapter) exist but lack proper discovery records in the context network. This creates knowledge management gaps.

## Original Recommendation
"Create discovery records for major implemented components"

## Why Deferred
- Medium effort required to properly document all components
- Needs investigation of actual implementation details
- Requires understanding of component relationships
- Should create proper location indexes

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create `discoveries/locations/progressive-loading.md` ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create `discoveries/locations/lens-system.md` ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Create `discoveries/locations/novel-adapter.md` ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] Update location indexes with new discoveries ✅ COMPLETE (index.md created)
- [x] Cross-link related concept documents ✅ COMPLETE (See also sections included)
- [x] Follow discovery record format from CLAUDE.md ✅ COMPLETE (Location index format used)

## Implementation Notes
Each discovery record should include:
- **What You Were Looking For**: Component implementation details
- **Found**: Specific file paths and line numbers
- **Summary**: One sentence explaining what the code does
- **Significance**: Why this matters for understanding the system
- **See also**: Links to related concepts and discoveries

## Estimated Effort
- Progressive Loading: 15 minutes
- Lens System: 15 minutes
- Novel Adapter: 10 minutes
- Index updates: 10 minutes
- Cross-linking: 10 minutes
- **Total**: ~60 minutes

## Related Tasks
- Update system architecture documentation
- Create concept maps for new implementations
