# Task: Optimize Batch Operations in DuckDB Adapter persist()

## Context
The persist() method in DuckDBStorageAdapter currently inserts rows one at a time in a loop, which is inefficient for large datasets.

## Original Recommendation
From code review on 2025-09-09:
- Batch operations could be optimized using prepared statements
- Current approach may cause performance issues with large datasets

## Current Implementation
```typescript
// Inefficient - one insert per iteration
for (const [key, value] of this.data) {
  const serializedValue = JSON.stringify(value)
  await connection.run(insertSQL, [key, serializedValue])
}
```

## Requirements

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement batch insert using prepared statements
- [ ] Maintain atomicity of persist operation
- [ ] Handle errors for individual rows appropriately
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Document performance improvements

### Proposed Solution
```typescript
// Prepare statement once, execute many times
const stmt = await connection.prepare(insertSQL)
try {
  for (const [key, value] of this.data) {
    const serializedValue = JSON.stringify(value)
    stmt.bind(key, serializedValue)
    await stmt.run()
  }
} finally {
  await stmt.close()
}
```

### Alternative: Use DuckDB Appender API
```typescript
const appender = await connection.createAppender(tableName)
for (const [key, value] of this.data) {
  appender.appendVarchar(key)
  appender.appendVarchar(JSON.stringify(value))
  appender.endRow()
}
await appender.flush()
appender.close()
```

## Performance Considerations
- Test with datasets of 1K, 10K, 100K records
- Measure time difference
- Monitor memory usage
- Consider chunking for very large datasets

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: Medium (1-2 hours including benchmarking)
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Risk**: Low (with proper testing)

## Benefits
- Significant performance improvement for bulk operations
- Reduced database round trips
- Better resource utilization
- Scalability improvement

## Priority
**Medium** - Performance optimization that affects large-scale usage
