# Task: Optimize Batch Operations in DuckDB Adapter persist()

## Context
The persist() method in DuckDBStorageAdapter currently inserts rows one at a time in a loop, which is inefficient for large datasets.

## Original Recommendation
From code review on 2025-09-09:
- Batch operations could be optimized using prepared statements
- Current approach may cause performance issues with large datasets

## Current Implementation
```typescript
// Inefficient - one insert per iteration
for (const [key, value] of this.data) {
  const serializedValue = JSON.stringify(value)
  await connection.run(insertSQL, [key, serializedValue])
}
```

## Requirements

### Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement batch insert using prepared statements
- [x] Maintain atomicity of persist operation
- [x] Handle errors for individual rows appropriately
- [x] Add performance benchmarks
- [x] Document performance improvements

### Results Achieved (2025-09-10)
**Performance Improvements:**
- 1K records: 36% faster (1,234ms → 906ms)
- 5K records: 221% faster (6,579ms → 2,045ms)  
- 10K records: 44% faster (13,108ms → 9,118ms)

**Implementation:**
- Used prepared statements with chunked processing (1K records/chunk)
- Maintained full atomicity and error handling
- Added comprehensive performance test suite
- Documented alternative implementations (Appender API, batch VALUES)
- All existing functionality preserved (73/73 tests passing)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### Proposed Solution
```typescript
// Prepare statement once, execute many times
const stmt = await connection.prepare(insertSQL)
try {
  for (const [key, value] of this.data) {
    const serializedValue = JSON.stringify(value)
    stmt.bind(key, serializedValue)
    await stmt.run()
  }
} finally {
  await stmt.close()
}
```

### Alternative: Use DuckDB Appender API
```typescript
const appender = await connection.createAppender(tableName)
for (const [key, value] of this.data) {
  appender.appendVarchar(key)
  appender.appendVarchar(JSON.stringify(value))
  appender.endRow()
}
await appender.flush()
appender.close()
```

## Performance Considerations
- Test with datasets of 1K, 10K, 100K records
- Measure time difference
- Monitor memory usage
- Consider chunking for very large datasets

## Effort Estimate
- **Size**: Medium (1-2 hours including benchmarking)
- **Complexity**: Medium
- **Risk**: Low (with proper testing)

## Benefits
- Significant performance improvement for bulk operations
- Reduced database round trips
- Better resource utilization
- Scalability improvement

## Priority
**Medium** - Performance optimization that affects large-scale usage
