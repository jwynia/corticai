# Implement Edge Type Filtering for Variable-Length Paths

## Task Definition
**Type**: Performance Optimization / Technical Debt
**Priority**: High
**Effort**: Medium (30-60 minutes)
**Dependencies**: Kuzu database capabilities

## Context
Currently, edge type filtering for variable-length graph traversal queries is handled in post-processing rather than in the query itself. This impacts performance for large graphs with many edge types.

## Original Recommendation
"Complete the TODO in KuzuSecureQueryBuilder for performance optimization"

## Why Deferred
- Requires understanding of Kuzu database variable-length path filtering capabilities
- May need performance benchmarking before and after
- Could impact query complexity and need careful testing
- Depends on Kuzu version features available

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Research Kuzu's current capabilities for variable-length path filtering with edge types
- [ ] Implement edge type filtering in query construction if possible
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks comparing pre/post-processing approaches
- [ ] Update documentation and remove TODO comment
- [ ] Ensure existing tests still pass
- [ ] Add specific tests for edge type filtering performance

## Implementation Notes
**Current Implementation**:
- File: `src/storage/adapters/KuzuSecureQueryBuilder.ts:109-111`
- Edge types handled in post-processing for performance reasons
- May be limited by Kuzu version capabilities

**Suggested Approach**:
1. Investigate Kuzu documentation for variable-length path filtering
2. Create performance test with large graph dataset
3. Implement query-level filtering if supported
4. Benchmark both approaches
5. Choose optimal solution based on results

## Estimated Effort
- Research: 15 minutes
- Implementation: 30 minutes
- Testing and benchmarking: 30 minutes
- Documentation: 10 minutes
- **Total**: ~85 minutes
