# Update Example Files to Use Structured Logging

## Task Definition
**Type**: Consistency / Code Quality
**Priority**: Low
**Effort**: Trivial (5-15 minutes)
**Dependencies**: None

## Context
Example files still use console.log statements while the rest of the codebase has moved to structured logging. For consistency and to demonstrate best practices, these should be updated.

## Original Recommendation
"Consider using the new Logger system for consistency in example files"

## Why Deferred
- Very low priority since these are example files
- No functional impact
- Can be done when working on those files for other reasons
- Good for newcomer contributors

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Replace console.log statements with Logger.info calls
- [ ] Import Logger at the top of example files
- [ ] Maintain the educational value of examples
- [ ] Ensure examples still work correctly
- [ ] Update any documentation that references the examples

## Files to Update
**Primary file**: `src/indexes/AttributeIndex.example.ts`
**Console statements at lines**: 42, 52, 55, 64, 72, 91, etc.

## Example Transformation
**Before**:
```typescript
console.log('TypeScript files:', Array.from(tsFiles));
console.log('Components:', Array.from(components));
```

**After**:
```typescript
import { Logger } from '../utils/Logger';

const logger = Logger.createConsoleLogger('AttributeIndexExample');

logger.info('TypeScript files found', { count: tsFiles.size, files: Array.from(tsFiles) });
logger.info('Components found', { count: components.size, components: Array.from(components) });
```

## Benefits
- Demonstrates proper logging practices
- Provides better structured output
- Shows how to use the Logger system
- Maintains consistency across codebase

## Implementation Notes
- Keep examples simple and educational
- Don't over-complicate with unnecessary context objects
- Preserve the "demonstration" nature of the code
- Consider adding comments about logging best practices

## Estimated Effort
- File review: 5 minutes
- Updates: 10 minutes
- Testing: 5 minutes
- **Total**: ~20 minutes

## Good First Issue
This would be an excellent task for new contributors to the project as it:
- Has clear requirements
- Low risk of breaking functionality
- Teaches the logging system
- Provides immediate visible results
