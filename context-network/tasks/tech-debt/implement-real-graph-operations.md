# Task: Implement Real Graph Operations in KuzuStorageAdapter

## Context
During the Phase 1 implementation of the Universal Context Engine, the KuzuStorageAdapter was created with mock implementations for complex graph operations. These need to be replaced with actual Cypher queries for production use.

## Current State
The following methods currently return mock/test data:
- `traverse(startId, pattern)` - Returns hardcoded test paths
- `findConnected(nodeId, depth)` - Returns mock connected nodes
- `shortestPath(fromId, toId)` - Returns simplified mock path

## Requirements

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement real Cypher queries for graph traversal
- [ ] Support variable depth traversal (1-5 levels)
- [ ] Handle disconnected nodes gracefully
- [ ] Implement actual shortest path algorithm using Kuzu's built-in functions
- [ ] Add support for different edge types in traversal patterns
- [ ] Ensure performance for graphs with 10k+ nodes
- [ ] Add proper indexes for common query patterns

### Implementation Guide

1. **traverse() Method**
```cypher
MATCH path = (start:Entity {id: $startId})-[*1..5]-(end)
WHERE /* apply pattern filters */
RETURN path
```

2. **findConnected() Method**
```cypher
MATCH (start:Entity {id: $nodeId})-[*1..$depth]-(connected)
RETURN DISTINCT connected
```

3. **shortestPath() Method**
```cypher
MATCH path = shortestPath((from:Entity {id: $fromId})-[*]-(to:Entity {id: $toId}))
RETURN path
```

### Performance Considerations
- Create indexes on Entity.id for fast lookups
- Consider implementing query result caching
- Use LIMIT clauses for large result sets
- Monitor query execution plans

## Dependencies
- Kuzu database must support the required Cypher features
- May need to upgrade Kuzu version for advanced graph algorithms

## Effort Estimate
**Large** (8-12 hours)
- Research Kuzu's Cypher dialect specifics
- Implement and test each method
- Performance testing with large graphs
- Documentation updates

## Priority
**Medium** - Current mock implementations work for basic testing, but real implementations needed before production use.

## Related
- Original code review identified this as a medium priority improvement
- Part of Phase 2: Continuity Cortex implementation will depend on these operations

## Notes
Consider implementing incrementally:
1. Start with simple findConnected()
2. Then implement traverse() with basic patterns
3. Finally add shortestPath() with optimization
