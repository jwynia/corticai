## Active High-Priority Tasks

### Documentation Alignment (Ready Now)
- **[Discovery Records Creation](./documentation-drift/discovery-records-creation.md)**
  - *Priority*: HIGH | *Effort*: Medium (60 min) | *Dependencies*: None
  - Document Progressive Loading, Lens System, and NovelAdapter implementations

- **[Current Phase Assessment](./planning/current-phase-assessment.md)**
  - *Priority*: HIGH | *Effort*: Medium (65 min) | *Dependencies*: Team discussion
  - Determine actual development phase and update roadmap

### Architecture Updates (Ready After Discovery Records)
- **[System Architecture Update](./architecture/system-architecture-update.md)**
  - *Priority*: Medium | *Effort*: Large (90 min) | *Dependencies*: Discovery records complete
  - Update architecture docs to reflect Progressive Loading and Lens System

### Process Improvements (Design Phase)
- **[Sync Automation](./process-improvement/sync-automation.md)**
  - *Priority*: Medium | *Effort*: Large (105 min) | *Dependencies*: Process design
  - Implement automated documentation sync triggers

## Task Categories

### By Priority
- **HIGH**: Discovery Records, Phase Assessment
- **MEDIUM**: Architecture Update, Sync Automation
- **LOW**: (none active)

### By Effort
- **Small** (< 30 min): (none active)
- **Medium** (30-60 min): Discovery Records, Phase Assessment
- **Large** (60+ min): Architecture Update, Sync Automation

### By Dependencies
- **Ready Now**: Discovery Records
- **Needs Team Input**: Phase Assessment
- **Needs Prerequisites**: Architecture Update (after discovery records)
- **Needs Design**: Sync Automation

## Sprint Integration

These tasks align with the groomed backlog and are included in the next sprint plan:
- Week 1: Discovery Records + Phase Assessment
- Week 2: Architecture Update
- Future: Sync Automation (after process design)

## Task Lifecycle

### Recently Created (2025-09-26)
All active tasks were created during the sync/groom/apply cycle to address the documentation drift identified between planning and implementation reality.

### Next Steps
1. Start with Discovery Records (no dependencies)
2. Proceed with Phase Assessment (requires strategic thinking)
3. Complete Architecture Update (uses discovery records)
4. Design and implement Sync Automation (prevents future drift)
