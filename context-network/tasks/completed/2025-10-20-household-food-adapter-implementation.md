## Design Patterns Demonstrated

### 1. Domain Adapter Pattern

Extends UniversalFallbackAdapter with:
- Domain-specific entity extraction
- Specialized relationship detection
- Custom metadata enrichment

### 2. Quantity Handling (New Pattern)

Normalizes diverse measurement units:
- Volume (cups, ml, tbsp)
- Weight (g, kg, oz, lb)
- Count (items, units)
- Custom (bunch, head, etc.)

### 3. Temporal Logic (New Pattern)

Handles dates and scheduling:
- Expiration date tracking
- Meal scheduling
- Purchase/consumption dates
- "Expiring soon" determination

### 4. Flexible JSON Parsing

Supports multiple data structures:
- Array of items
- Nested objects with items array
- Single entities
- Type-tagged objects

### 5. Practical Query Patterns

Real-world queries not in other adapters:
- "What can I make with current ingredients?"
- "What's expiring soon?"
- "Generate shopping list from meal plan"
- "Find recipes under 30 minutes"

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **TDD Approach** - Writing tests first clarified requirements and caught edge cases
2. **Pattern Reuse** - Extending UniversalFallbackAdapter reduced implementation time
3. **Flexible JSON** - Supporting multiple data structures improved usability
4. **Real Data** - Example kitchen data made testing and documentation more concrete
5. **Practical Focus** - Household domain different enough to validate versatility

### Challenges

1. **Unit Normalization** - Quantity handling is complex (map different units)
2. **Date Calculations** - Expiration logic requires careful date math
3. **Test Expectations** - Some tests check for calculated metadata (canMake flag)
4. **Edge Cases** - Recipes without names, meals without dates, etc.

### What We'd Do Differently

1. **Earlier unit conversion** - Could have built unit normalization as separate utility
2. **Calculated fields** - Could delay canMake/missing ingredient calculation to query time
3. **More integration tests** - Could have more tests showing real workflow scenarios
4. **Lazy evaluation** - Shopping list generation could be on-demand rather than automatic

### Medium-term Enhancements

1. **Nutrition analysis** - Extend household adapter with calorie/macro data
2. **Budget tracking** - Cost optimization for meal planning
3. **Batch cooking** - Suggest meal prep strategies
4. **Seasonal awareness** - Recommend recipes based on ingredient availability

### Long-term Vision

1. **CorticAI self-hosting** - Use HouseholdFoodAdapter pattern for project management
2. **Multi-domain queries** - "Show code comments for recipes I'm planning"
3. **Learning patterns** - Track meal preferences and suggest new recipes
4. **Export/sharing** - Share meal plans, shopping lists, recipes

## Conclusion

HouseholdFoodAdapter successfully demonstrates CorticAI's universal context engine works across household/personal management domains. The third domain adapter validates the universal pattern with new requirements (quantities, dates, practical queries) while maintaining zero regressions in the existing system.

This adapter proves that CorticAI can handle diverse domains beyond code and narrative, enabling real-world household applications while maintaining the clean architecture and testing standards established in previous implementations.

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE - All acceptance criteria met, production ready

**Next Steps**: Select next domain adapter to implement (Documents, Music, Projects) or enhance existing adapters with requested features.
