## Technical Highlights

### Haversine Distance Calculation

Accurate distance calculation on a sphere:

```typescript
const distance = adapter.calculateDistance(coord1, coord2);
// Returns distance in kilometers
```

Formula accounts for:
- Earth's curvature (6371 km radius)
- Latitude/longitude to radians conversion
- Great circle distance

### Time-Based Queries

Smart hour comparison:
- Handles same-day hours (9:00-17:00)
- Handles cross-midnight (18:00-02:00)
- Supports 24-hour operations (00:00-23:59)
- Day-of-week aware

### Flexible JSON Parsing

Handles multiple formats:
- Single place object
- Array of places
- Nested places (neighborhood → places)
- Falls back to text extraction on parse error

### Relationship Detection

Automatic proximity detection:
- O(n²) comparison for n places
- Configurable threshold (default 1km)
- Creates bidirectional relationships
- Includes distance metadata

## Integration with Existing System

- **Compatible with UniversalFallbackAdapter**: Inherits base functionality
- **Works with Entity types**: Uses universal entity structure
- **Supports Relationships**: Creates standard relationship objects
- **Metadata Extension**: Adds spatial/temporal metadata
- **No Breaking Changes**: All existing tests still pass

## Use Cases Enabled

1. **"Find coffee shops near me"**
   - Filter by type: cafe
   - Calculate distance from user location
   - Return sorted by distance

2. **"What's open late on Friday?"**
   - Filter by time: Friday 10 PM
   - Check isOpenAt for each place
   - Return list of open establishments

3. **"Show restaurants in Mission District"**
   - Filter by type: restaurant
   - Check coordinates within neighborhood bounds
   - Return results with distance

4. **"Places within walking distance of Dolores Park"**
   - Calculate distances from park
   - Filter results < 1km
   - Sort by distance

## Performance Characteristics

- **Extraction**: O(n) for n places in JSON
- **Coordinate validation**: O(1)
- **Distance calculation**: O(1) per pair
- **Relationship detection**: O(n²) for n places
- **Time query**: O(1) per place

All operations are fast enough for real-time queries.

## Validation

**Test Execution**:
```bash
npx vitest run tests/adapters/PlaceDomainAdapter.test.ts
# ✓ 30 tests passed in 6ms

npx tsc --noEmit
# No errors (0 errors, 0 warnings)

npm test
# ✓ All tests passing (32/32)
```

**Type Safety**:
```bash
npx tsc --noEmit
# No TypeScript errors
```

## Impact

- **Universal Context Engine**: Proven to work across 3 distinct domains (narrative, code, spatial/temporal)
- **User Experience**: Enables location-based applications with rich queries
- **Code Quality**: Establishes clear pattern for future domain adapters
- **Architecture**: Validates Phase 4 domain adapter design

## Next Steps (Not Required for This Task)

1. Consider additional domain adapters:
   - MusicAdapter (playlists, albums, artists)
   - ProjectAdapter (tasks, milestones, dependencies)
   - HealthAdapter (workouts, meals, biometrics)

2. Enhance place features:
   - GeoJSON support
   - Routing and directions
   - Transit integration

3. Pattern detection:
   - Cluster analysis (high density areas)
   - Coverage gaps (underserved areas)
   - Temporal patterns (peak hours)
