# Task: Make Performance Tests More Robust

## Priority: Low

## Context
Performance tests currently use absolute timing thresholds (e.g., < 1000ms, < 10ms) which can fail on slower CI machines or under load. Tests should focus on algorithmic complexity rather than absolute timing.

## Original Recommendation
"Time-Dependent Performance Tests - These can fail on slower CI machines or under load"

## Why Deferred
- Current tests work in development environment
- Not causing immediate CI/CD issues
- Requires rethinking performance testing strategy
- Low impact on actual functionality

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Performance tests measure relative performance, not absolute times
- [ ] Tests verify algorithmic complexity (O(1), O(n), etc.)
- [ ] Tests pass consistently across different environments
- [ ] Performance regressions are still detected
- [ ] Clear documentation of what's being tested

## Technical Approach

### Current Approach (Problematic)
```javascript
expect(queryTime).toBeLessThan(10); // Absolute threshold
```

### Improved Approach 1: Relative Performance
```javascript
// Test that query time doesn't increase with dataset size
const time1000 = measureQueryTime(1000);
const time10000 = measureQueryTime(10000);
expect(time10000).toBeLessThan(time1000 * 2); // Should be O(1), not O(n)
```

### Improved Approach 2: Statistical Analysis
```javascript
// Run multiple iterations and check consistency
const times = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  times.push(measureQueryTime());
}
const stdDev = calculateStdDev(times);
expect(stdDev).toBeLessThan(meanTime * 0.2); // Consistent performance
```

### Improved Approach 3: Complexity Verification
```javascript
// Verify O(1) lookup complexity
const datasets = [100, 1000, 10000];
const times = datasets.map(size => ({
  size,
  time: measureQueryTimeForSize(size)
}));
verifyComplexity(times, 'O(1)');
```

## Effort Estimate
- **Development**: 3-4 hours
- **Testing**: 1 hour
- **Total**: Small-Medium (4-5 hours)

## Dependencies
- May need to add statistical utilities
- Should align with overall performance testing strategy

## Success Metrics
- Zero false-positive test failures due to timing
- Performance regressions still detected
- Tests provide meaningful complexity guarantees
- CI/CD pipeline reliability improved

## Related Items
- Memory test improvements
- CI/CD pipeline optimization
- Performance benchmarking strategy

## Notes
- Consider creating a performance testing utilities module
- Could add performance benchmarks as separate non-blocking tests
- Document expected complexity for each operation
- Consider using benchmark.js or similar for more sophisticated testing
