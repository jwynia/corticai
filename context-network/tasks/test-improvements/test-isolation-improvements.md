# Task: Improve Test Isolation and Independence

## Priority
Low

## Source
Test quality review - 2025-09-09

## Problem Statement
Some tests may have interdependencies or shared state issues:
- File cleanup in `afterEach` hooks could fail silently
- No verification that tests are truly isolated
- Potential for test order dependencies
- Shared state between test instances

## Current Issues

### Potential State Leakage
1. File system state persisting between tests
2. Global variables or singletons
3. Incomplete cleanup after test failures
4. Shared test data mutations

### Missing Isolation Verification
- No tests that verify test independence
- No randomized test execution order
- No detection of state leakage

## Proposed Improvements

### 1. Add Test Isolation Verification
```typescript
describe('Test Isolation Verification', () => {
  it('should not be affected by previous test state', () => {
    // This test should pass regardless of what ran before
    const storage = new MemoryStorageAdapter()
    expect(storage.size()).resolves.toBe(0)
  })
  
  it.concurrent.each([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])(
    'concurrent test %i should be independent',
    async (num) => {
      const storage = new MemoryStorageAdapter()
      await storage.set(`key${num}`, `value${num}`)
      expect(await storage.size()).toBe(1)
    }
  )
})
```

### 2. Implement Robust Cleanup
```typescript
afterEach(async () => {
  try {
    await cleanup()
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Cleanup failed:', error)
    // Force cleanup
    await forceCleanup()
  } finally {
    // Verify cleanup succeeded
    expect(await getTestArtifacts()).toHaveLength(0)
  }
})
```

### 3. Add Test Order Randomization
```typescript
// vitest.config.ts
export default {
  test: {
    sequence: {
      shuffle: true  // Randomize test execution order
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Steps
1. Audit all test files for shared state
2. Add isolation verification tests
3. Implement robust cleanup utilities
4. Enable test randomization in CI
5. Add state leak detection
6. Document test isolation requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Tests pass when run in random order
- [ ] No test failures due to previous test state
- [ ] Cleanup always succeeds or reports errors
- [ ] Each test starts with clean state
- [ ] Concurrent tests don't interfere
- [ ] Test isolation is automatically verified

## Estimated Effort
Small (5-30 minutes per test file)

## Benefits
- More reliable tests
- Easier debugging
- Better parallelization
- Catch hidden dependencies
- Improved CI reliability
