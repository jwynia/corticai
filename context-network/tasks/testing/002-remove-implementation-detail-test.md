# Task: Remove Implementation Detail Test

## Priority: LOW - Code Quality

## Context
There's a test that verifies a method exists rather than testing its behavior. This is testing implementation details rather than functionality.

## Original Recommendation
From test review: "Testing that a method exists rather than its behavior"

## Current Implementation
```typescript
it('should have an extract method', () => {
  expect(adapter.extract).toBeDefined();
  expect(typeof adapter.extract).toBe('function');
});
```

## Why Deferred
- Very low priority - test isn't harmful
- Other tests implicitly verify the method exists by using it
- Part of "Basic Functionality" test suite that provides some value
- Could be bundled with other test improvements

## Suggested Approach

### Option 1: Remove the Test
Simply delete this test as it provides minimal value and other tests verify the method works.

### Option 2: Convert to Interface Compliance Test
```typescript
it('should implement DomainAdapter interface', () => {
  // Test that adapter implements the full interface
  expect(adapter).toHaveProperty('extract');
  expect(adapter.extract).toBeInstanceOf(Function);
  // Could use TypeScript type checking instead
});
```

### Option 3: Keep for Documentation
Keep the test but rename it to be clearer about its purpose:
```typescript
it('should conform to DomainAdapter interface with extract method', () => {
  // This verifies the public API contract
  expect(adapter.extract).toBeDefined();
  expect(adapter.extract.length).toBe(2); // Expects 2 parameters
});
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Decision made on whether to keep or remove test
- [ ] If kept, test renamed to clarify purpose
- [ ] If removed, verify other tests provide coverage
- [ ] No reduction in meaningful test coverage

## Effort Estimate
- **Development**: 5 minutes
- **Testing**: 5 minutes
- **Total**: 10 minutes

## Dependencies
- None - isolated change

## Success Metrics
- Test suite remains comprehensive
- No loss of meaningful coverage
- Clearer test intent

## Notes
- This is a very minor improvement
- Could be bundled with other test refactoring
- Not urgent as test isn't causing problems
