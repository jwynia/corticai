## Network Principles

This context network serves as the single source of truth for all project coordination. All planning documents, conceptual models, and design discussions must be stored within this network structure.

## Updates and Maintenance

Recent updates are tracked in [Meta Updates](meta/updates/index.md). For network maintenance procedures, see [Maintenance Guide](meta/maintenance.md).
