# Research Queries: The Wisdom of Both

## Research Command Usage

### Basic Usage
To run a research query, use the following command from within the research directory:

```bash
research "Your research question here?"
```

For example:
```bash
cd research && research "How do different cultures balance individual autonomy with collective responsibility?"
```

### Output Location
- The research command generates a markdown file with the results
- Output files are saved to the `research/output` directory with a timestamp and UUID in the filename
- Example: `2025-04-03-03-09-45-344a29b2-9ec3-49ab-85af-7e190ba239c0.md`

### Organization Process
After running research queries, the output files should be:
1. Copied from the `research/output` directory to the appropriate chapter directory
2. Renamed with a descriptive filename that reflects the content

For example:
```bash
cp research/output/2025-04-03-03-09-45-344a29b2-9ec3-49ab-85af-7e190ba239c0.md research/by-chapter/ch4-individual-and-collective/cultural-balance-autonomy-responsibility.md
```

## Research Workflow

### Process Overview
1. Identify research questions based on chapter needs
2. Run research queries using the `research` command
3. Review the output in the `research/output` directory
4. Copy and rename the files to the appropriate chapter directory
5. Integrate the research findings into the manuscript

### Best Practices
- Formulate clear, specific research questions
- Organize research files with descriptive names
- Maintain the chapter directory structure
- Document research activities in the research log
- Synthesize findings across related topics
