# Memory-Bank Migration Record

## Migration Date
June 28, 2025

## Purpose
This document records the migration of the original memory-bank structure into the new context network organization.

## Original Memory-Bank Structure
```

├── productContext.md     # Project vision and problems addressed
├── progress.md           # Detailed progress tracking
├── projectbrief.md       # High-level project overview
├── researchQueries.md    # Research workflow and completed queries
├── systemPatterns.md     # Technical patterns and content architecture
└── techContext.md        # Development environment and constraints
```
