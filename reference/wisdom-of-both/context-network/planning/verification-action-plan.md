## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1: Critical Replacements
**Days 1-3:** Replace all Chapter 10 & 13 case studies
- Use documented case replacements
- Rewrite sections to integrate smoothly
- Update source notes

**Days 4-5:** Replace personal anecdotes
- Choose between memoir citations or generic scenarios
- Maintain teaching value while ensuring authenticity
- Update source tracking

### Week 2: Citation Verification
**Days 6-8:** Neuroscience and psychology citations
- Verify all brain/mind research claims
- Add proper academic citations
- Flag any claims that can't be verified

**Days 9-10:** Statistics and data verification
- Check all numerical claims
- Update with latest available data
- Add source citations

### Week 3: Cultural Verification
**Days 11-13:** Indigenous and Eastern philosophy
- Verify all cultural attributions
- Ensure respectful representation
- Add appropriate context

**Days 14-15:** Final review and integration
- Cross-check all changes
- Ensure smooth narrative flow
- Update tracking document

## Quality Standards

### For Case Study Replacements
- Must be from verifiable published sources
- Should maintain the teaching value of original
- Need proper citations and permissions where applicable
- Should feel natural within the narrative flow

### For Anecdote Replacements
- Can be generic scenarios without false claims
- Should preserve the pedagogical purpose
- Must avoid claiming personal experience falsely
- Should maintain reader engagement

### For Research Citations
- Primary sources preferred over secondary
- Recent research (within 10 years) for scientific claims
- Classic sources acceptable for established theories
- All claims must be verifiable

## Tracking and Documentation

### Use Existing System
- Update `/context-network/elements/content/source-verification-tracking.md`
- Mark items as verified with ✓
- Document all source changes
- Note any items that couldn't be verified

### Version Control
- Keep original text in comments for reference
- Document why each change was made
- Maintain change log for transparency

## Success Criteria

1. **No AI-generated content** presented as real examples
2. **All research claims** have verifiable citations
3. **Cultural references** are accurate and respectful
4. **Narrative flow** remains smooth and engaging
5. **Teaching value** is maintained or enhanced

## Next Steps After Verification

1. **Professional fact-checking** of verified content
2. **Legal review** for any quoted materials
3. **Cultural sensitivity review** by appropriate experts
4. **Copy editing** to ensure smooth integration
5. **Final quality assurance** before any external sharing

## Risk Mitigation

### Before Completion
- Do not share any chapters externally
- Mark all drafts as "Internal Review Only"
- Be transparent about verification status

### After Completion
- Consider adding note about illustrative examples
- Include comprehensive bibliography
- Maintain documentation of all sources
