## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Active
- **Abstraction:** Strategic
- **Confidence:** High

## Key Findings from Analysis

### Strengths to Preserve
- Chapter 2's comprehensive global coverage

- **African**: Strong in Ubuntu but missing other traditions
- **Pacific Islander**: Minimal beyond navigation wisdom
- **Middle Eastern**: Limited beyond Sufism
- **Indigenous Australian**: Scattered mentions only

#### 2. Missing Perspectives
- **Women's Wisdom Traditions**: Need systematic integration
- **Contemporary Liberation Movements**: Disability, LGBTQ+, environmental justice
- **Economic Justice Voices**: Global South perspectives on wealth/poverty
- **Youth Wisdom**: Intergenerational knowledge missing

#### 3. Western-Centric Framing
- Chapter 1: Heavy neuroscience/Western philosophy
- Chapter 9: Privileged "voluntary simplicity"
- Chapter 10: Capitalist success frameworks
- Digital discussions assume Global North access
