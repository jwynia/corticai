## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Active
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** High

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Strengths
- Mentions Buddhist "two truths" and Heart Sutra

## Specific Text Additions

### Indigenous Sacred Knowledge Section
"Indigenous traditions worldwide have sophisticated approaches to sacred knowledge that challenge Western assumptions about transparency and universality. Knowledge is often understood as alive, powerful, and requiring proper relationship.

In Māori tradition, whakapapa (genealogical knowledge) connects individuals to ancestors, land, and cosmos. This knowledge is tapu (sacred) and revealed progressively through proper protocols. As Māori scholar Ani Mikaere explains, some knowledge is dangerous if accessed without proper spiritual preparation—not from superstition but from understanding that knowledge carries responsibility and power.

Andean Quechua traditions distinguish between different types of knowing: yachay (intellectual knowledge), munay (love-wisdom of the heart), and llank'ay (knowledge through doing). The integration of all three creates kawsay—the art of living in right relationship. Certain knowledge, particularly of sacred sites and ceremonies, remains deliberately hidden to protect both the knowledge and those who might misuse it.

Many African societies maintain age-grade systems where knowledge is revealed progressively. The Poro societies of West Africa initiate young people into adult knowledge through ceremonies that can last months. Not all knowledge is for everyone; wisdom includes knowing what knowledge belongs to which life stage. This isn't about hierarchy but about readiness—like not teaching calculus before arithmetic."

### Persian 'Irfan Addition
"The Persian tradition of 'irfan represents one of humanity's most sophisticated approaches to mystical knowledge. Distinguished from both rational philosophy (falsafa) and theology (kalam), 'irfan seeks ma'rifa—direct experiential knowledge of the divine that transcends conceptual understanding.

Suhrawardi's illuminationist philosophy (hikmat al-ishraq) proposed that true knowledge comes through mystical intuition (dhawq) confirmed by rational demonstration. Light serves as both metaphor and reality—knowledge illuminates and is illumination. This influenced centuries of Persian thought, from poetry to politics.

The 8th-century mystic Rabi'a al-Adawiyya, though Arab, profoundly influenced Persian 'irfan by introducing the concept of divine love as the highest knowledge. Her famous prayer—'O God, if I worship You for fear of Hell, burn me in Hell; if I worship You in hope of Paradise, exclude me from Paradise. But if I worship You for Your Own sake, grudge me not Your everlasting Beauty'—demonstrates knowledge that transcends transaction.

Contemporary Iranian philosophers like Seyyed Hossein Nasr continue this tradition, arguing that 'irfan offers essential insights for ecological crisis and meaning-making in technological society. This knowledge cannot be googled or reduced to information—it requires transformation of the knower."

### Decolonial Knowledge Section
"The colonization of knowledge represents one of history's great violences—what Portuguese sociologist Boaventura de Sousa Santos calls 'epistemicide.' Colonial powers didn't just exploit resources and labor; they systematically destroyed ways of knowing, declaring millennia-old knowledge systems 'primitive' or 'superstitious.'

Yet knowledge systems demonstrated remarkable resilience. In the Andes, quipu (knot-records) preserved complex information despite Spanish attempts to destroy them. Recent research suggests these contained not just numerical data but narrative, poetry, and philosophy—a entire civilization's knowledge in thread and knot.

African traditional medicine knowledge survived through women healers who encoded botanical wisdom in songs and stories that appeared harmless to colonizers. The very characteristics that made knowledge seem 'unscientific'—oral transmission, ceremonial context, metaphorical language—protected it from destruction.

Today's movements for cognitive justice recognize that decolonizing knowledge means more than adding diverse examples to Western frameworks. It requires recognizing different ways of validating truth, transmitting wisdom, and understanding what knowledge is for. As Māori scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith argues, indigenous peoples must reclaim the right to define what counts as knowledge and how it should be shared."
