- Verify organizational studies
- Update leadership research
- Check innovation claims
- Validate productivity research

#### Day 18-21: Final Integration
- Cross-check all citations
- Ensure formatting consistency
- Update bibliography
- Final quality review

## Verification Protocols

### For Each Citation

1. **Locate Primary Source**
   - Find original study/text
   - Verify quote accuracy
   - Check context appropriateness

2. **Assess Quality**
   - Peer-reviewed preferred
   - Recent (within 10 years) for science
   - Authoritative for philosophy/culture

3. **Document Updates**
   ```markdown
   ## Citation Update Record
   
   **Chapter**: [X]
   **Original Claim**: "[Quote or paraphrase]"
   **Original Status**: Unsourced/Incorrect/Outdated
   
   **Updated Source**: [Full citation]
   **Verification Date**: [Date]
   **Quality Assessment**: [Peer-reviewed/Authoritative/etc.]
   
   **Impact on Argument**: [None/Minor/Major]
   **Additional Changes Needed**: [If any]
   ```

4. **Update Manuscript**
   - Add in-text citation
   - Update reference list
   - Adjust claim if needed
   - Note in source verification

## Risk Management

### Potential Issues

1. **Unavailable Sources**
   - Strategy: Find alternative supporting evidence
   - Fallback: Acknowledge uncertainty
   - Document: Note in limitations

2. **Contradictory Research**
   - Strategy: Present both sides
   - Approach: Embrace as paradox
   - Frame: Strengthens thesis

3. **Outdated Claims**
   - Strategy: Update with recent findings
   - Maintain: Core argument validity
   - Enhance: Contemporary relevance

4. **Cultural Sensitivity**
   - Strategy: Consult experts
   - Priority: Respectful representation
   - Document: Attribution sources
