# Quality Assurance Network Relationships

## Classification
- **Domain**: Process Integration
- **Stability**: Semi-stable (relationships may expand with new processes)
- **Abstraction**: Structural (relationship mapping)
- **Confidence**: Established (based on completed quality assurance implementation)

## Overview
Documentation of critical relationships between quality assurance processes, standards, and outcomes in manuscript development.

## Core Relationship Network

### Quality Assurance Framework Hub
**[[Manuscript Quality Assurance Framework]]** serves as the central hub connecting:
