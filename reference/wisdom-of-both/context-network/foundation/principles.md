### Core Philosophy

#### Paradox as Feature
The fundamental principle underlying this project is that paradox is not a problem to be solved but a feature to be embraced. Following Niels Bohr's insight that "the opposite of a profound truth may very well be another profound truth," we approach seemingly contradictory wisdom as complementary rather than conflicting.

#### Both/And Thinking
Rather than defaulting to either/or binary thinking, this project consistently applies both/and frameworks that allow multiple truths to coexist and inform each other.

#### Scale-Dependent Truth Recognition
Understanding that wisdom can invert to its opposite when examined at different scales of observation. What proves true at the individual level may become false at the collective level; what works in detail may fail in pattern; what serves in the moment may harm across time.

#### Integration Over Elimination
When encountering opposing perspectives, the default approach is integration and synthesis rather than choosing sides or eliminating contradictions.
