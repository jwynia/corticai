# Retrospective: Manuscript Build Process Implementation - 2025-07-07

## Task Summary
- **Objective:** Create a script to compile markdown files into a Word document using pandoc with a template, and extract references to separate files
- **Outcome:** Successfully implemented build infrastructure with compilation and reference extraction scripts
- **Key Learnings:** 
  1. File naming convention discovery (000-Name.md pattern)
  2. Two-step pandoc process required for template application
  3. Build infrastructure benefits from dedicated directories

## Context Network Updates

### New Nodes Created
- **[processes/technical-workflow/build-process.md]**: Comprehensive documentation of manuscript compilation workflow, script infrastructure, and template management
- **[decisions/reference-management-strategy.md]**: Decision record documenting the approach to reference extraction and management

### Nodes Modified
- **[processes/technical-workflow/index.md]**: Added build process to core components list
- **[foundation/structure/directory-structure.md]**: Updated to include new directories (scripts/, templates/, build/, manuscript/references/)

### New Relationships
- build-process.md → implements → reference-management-strategy.md
- build-process.md → extends → directory-structure.md
- build-process.md → uses → file-management.md standards
- reference-management-strategy.md → affects → publication-readiness-assessment.md

### Navigation Enhancements
- Technical workflow now includes clear path to build processes
- Directory structure documentation reflects current project state

## Patterns and Insights

### Recurring Themes
1. **Infrastructure Evolution**: Project grows organically with new capabilities
2. **Convention Discovery**: Existing conventions (like file naming) must be discovered and respected
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Build artifacts separate from source content

### Process Improvements
1. **Script Reusability**: Shell scripts provide simple, dependency-free automation
2. **Template Management**: Centralized template location improves maintainability
3. **Reference Flexibility**: Extraction approach balances clean output with content preservation

### Knowledge Gaps Identified
1. **Publication Workflow**: How build process integrates with final publication needs more documentation
2. **Template Customization**: Guidelines for modifying templates could be helpful
3. **Multi-format Output**: Future consideration for PDF, ePub, or other formats

## Follow-up Recommendations

1. **Document Publication Workflow** [Priority: Medium]
   - How build outputs connect to publication process
   - Quality checks before final submission
   - Version management for submissions

2. **Create Build Automation Guide** [Priority: Low]
   - Instructions for customizing scripts
   - Adding new output formats
   - Integrating with CI/CD if needed

3. **Template Documentation** [Priority: Low]
   - How to modify the Merriweather template
   - Creating templates for other formats
   - Template versioning strategy

## Metrics
- Nodes created: 2
- Nodes modified: 2
- Relationships added: 4
- Estimated future time saved: 2-3 hours per manuscript compilation cycle

## Implementation Impact

### Immediate Benefits
1. **Automated Compilation**: Manual process replaced with single command
2. **Clean Output**: References extracted for focused reading experience
3. **Reproducible Builds**: Consistent output format every time

### Long-term Value
1. **Foundation for Automation**: Scripts can be extended for additional tasks
2. **Clear Documentation**: Future users can understand and modify process
3. **Scalable Approach**: Can handle additional manuscripts or formats

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Insights
1. **Pandoc Workflow**: Native format intermediate step crucial for template application
2. **Shell Scripting**: Sufficient for build automation without complex dependencies
3. **File Organization**: Dedicated directories for build infrastructure improve clarity

### Process Insights
1. **Discovery Before Implementation**: Understanding existing conventions prevents rework
2. **Incremental Development**: Starting with basic functionality allows quick iteration
3. **Documentation During Development**: Capturing decisions immediately preserves context

## Conclusion

The manuscript build process implementation successfully addressed the immediate need while establishing infrastructure for future enhancements. The separation of references provides flexibility for citation management, and the build scripts automate previously manual processes. Documentation in the context network ensures this knowledge is preserved and discoverable for future work.
