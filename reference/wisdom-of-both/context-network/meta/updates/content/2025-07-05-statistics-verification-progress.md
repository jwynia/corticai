2. **Future citation error** - "Cerebral Cortex, 2025" needs correction (impossible future date)
3. **Missing context** - Several statistics lack year references or full context

### Quality Improvements
- Updated all statistics to most recent available data
- Added specific years for all data points
- Included organization names in citations
- Corrected misinterpretations (e.g., Argentina)

## Documents Created
1. `manuscript/statistics-to-verify.md` - Comprehensive list of 40+ statistics needing verification
2. `manuscript/verified-statistics.md` - Verified statistics with citations ready for implementation

## Next Steps
1. Implement verified statistics in manuscript chapters
2. Continue verification of remaining ~33 statistics
3. Priority areas:
   - ROWE productivity claims
   - Justice system statistics (Chapter 12)
   - Health/wellbeing statistics (Chapter 11)
   - Cultural claims needing context

## Impact
Seven major statistics are now properly verified and updated with current data. This represents approximately 17% of identified statistics, with clear documentation for implementation. The Argentina correction prevents a significant error from appearing in the final manuscript.
