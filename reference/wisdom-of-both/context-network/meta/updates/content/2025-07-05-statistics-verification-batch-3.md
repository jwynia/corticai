**Type**: Statistics Verification Final Batch
**Category**: Content Verification
**Impact**: High - 2 additional statistics verified, 2 problematic statistics identified for correction

## Work Completed

### Statistics Verified (2 additional)

12. **Time Banking Systems**
    - Verified: 500+ time banks in US alone validates "500+ systems globally"
    - US: ~500 registered time banks, 37,000+ members
    - Source: Scholar Commons University of South Carolina (2024)

    - Constitutional mandate: minimum 60%
    - Source: Royal Bhutanese Embassy (2016), National Forest Inventory (2023)

### Statistics Requiring Correction (2 identified)

14. **Thai Buddhist Prison Therapy**
    - Claimed: "40% lower recidivism"
    - Reality: NO EVIDENCE for 40% reduction
    - Finding: Mindfulness programs show benefits for well-being, but no recidivism data
    - Action needed: Revise to focus on well-being benefits

15. **Māori Marae Justice**
    - Claimed: "50% drop in youth reoffending"
    - Reality: 6-15% reduction in studies
    - Finding: Significant overstatement of effectiveness
    - Action needed: Correct to accurate 6-15% range

### Verification Status Update
- **Total verified**: 13 out of 40+ statistics (32.5% complete)
- **Accurate claims**: 11 verified as stated or updated with better data
- **Problematic claims**: 4 identified (2 requiring correction, 2 unverifiable)
- **Remaining**: ~25 statistics still needing verification

## Key Findings
1. **Quality Pattern**: Some statistics are significantly overstated (50% vs 6-15%)
2. **Evidence Gaps**: Some claims lack any supporting research
3. **Data Updates**: Several statistics can be improved with more recent data
4. **Citation Needs**: All verified statistics now have proper citations

## Next Actions Required
1. **Manuscript corrections**: Update Thai Buddhist therapy and Māori justice claims
2. **Continue verification**: Mumbai dabbawalas, Aravind Eye Hospital, Google 20% time
3. **Implement verified statistics**: Begin updating manuscript with verified data
4. **Final review**: Complete remaining ~25 statistics

## Impact Assessment
This batch identified serious accuracy issues requiring immediate correction. The 50% vs 6-15% discrepancy for Māori justice and the unsupported 40% recidivism claim for Thai Buddhist therapy highlight the importance of rigorous verification before publication.
