## Reason for Update
User identified that context network had not been updated to reflect recent work completion, particularly the full 30-Day Paradox Challenge (Days 0-30) which was showing as only Days 1-7 complete.

## Impact
- Accurate project status now reflected across all planning documents
- Clear next steps identified (research verification, PDF templates, Chapter 13)
- Better visibility into actual project progress (92% complete)
- Proper documentation of major deliverable completion

## Follow-up Actions
1. Continue regular context network updates as work progresses
2. Create PDF templates for 30-day challenge
3. Complete Chapter 13 "The Wisdom of Balance"
4. Begin research verification and synthesis tasks

## Lessons Learned
Regular context network updates are critical for maintaining accurate project status. The CLAUDE.md instructions about updating every 3-5 significant changes should be followed more closely to prevent such gaps.
