## Work Completed

### Statistics Verified (6 additional)

14. **Mumbai Dabbawalas Six Sigma Efficiency**
    - Verified: ✓ Six Sigma rating with 99.999999% accuracy (1 error in 16 million transactions)
    - Source: Harvard Business School case study, Forbes Global (1998)

15. **Aravind Eye Hospital Cost Efficiency**
    - Verified: ✓ Cataract surgery at ~1% of Western costs ($120 vs $3,000+)
    - Source: PubMed (2016), PMC (2014)

    - Source: ProjectTimes (2014), IdeaWake (2024)

17. **Depression Rates and Social Connection**

    - Source: EBRI (2024), LIMRA (2024)

### Statistics Requiring Revision (1 identified)

20. **Cultural Differences in Relationships**
    - Claimed: "35% higher satisfaction"
    - Reality: Cross-cultural couples can achieve equal/higher satisfaction, but no evidence for 35% figure
    - Action needed: Revise to qualitative description without specific percentage

### Critical Discovery
- **Manuscript Already Corrected**: Previously identified problematic Thai Buddhist therapy and Māori justice claims were already corrected in the actual manuscript chapters - only appeared in tracking documents

### Verification Status Update
- **Total verified**: 19 out of 40+ statistics (47.5% complete)
- **Accurate claims**: 16 verified as stated or updated with better data
- **Problematic claims**: 5 identified (2 requiring correction, 3 unverifiable specific figures)
- **Remaining**: ~20 statistics still needing verification

## Key Business and Healthcare Insights

### Business Efficiency Claims
- Mumbai dabbawalas Six Sigma claim fully supported by Harvard case study
- Aravind Eye Hospital 1% cost claim verified with specific dollar amounts
- Google 20% time requires context about current status (discontinued as universal practice)

### Healthcare Statistics Pattern
- Depression/social connection claims well-supported by longitudinal studies
- Stress statistics align with major national surveys (APA)
- Mental health support figures accurate but should include range rather than single number
- Specific percentages for relationship satisfaction appear to be unsupported

## Next Priority Areas
1. **Environmental Statistics**: Bhutan forest cover verification (completed)
2. **Remaining Justice Statistics**: Truth and Reconciliation Commission statistics
3. **Cultural Claims**: Indigenous knowledge statistics requiring expert consultation
4. **Final Verification**: Complete remaining ~20 statistics

## Quality Assessment
- **Business Claims**: Strong verification with authoritative sources
- **Health Claims**: Generally well-supported by peer-reviewed research
- **Cultural Claims**: More challenging to verify, often require qualitative rather than quantitative treatment
- **Percentage Precision**: Pattern shows many specific percentages lack precise supporting evidence

## Impact
This batch focused on business efficiency and healthcare statistics, establishing strong verification for major claims while identifying the pattern that precise percentages often lack supporting evidence. The discovery that manuscript chapters already contain corrected statistics is positive for publication readiness.
