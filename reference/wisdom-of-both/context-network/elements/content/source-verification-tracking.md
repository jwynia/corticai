## Content

### Source Marking System

All chapters should include a "Source Notes" section at the end with these categories:

1. **Real Research/Verified Sources**: Published research, established theories, verified cultural concepts
2. **AI-Generated Content**: Personal anecdotes, examples, or stories created by AI agents (not the author's actual experiences)
3. **Illustrative Examples (To Be Replaced)**: Fictional case studies and composite characters that need real replacements
4. **Concepts Requiring Verification**: Terms, frameworks, or attributions that need fact-checking

**Important Note**: Many "personal anecdotes" in the manuscript were generated by AI agents during the writing process and should not be presented as the author's actual experiences. These need to be either:
- Replaced with real examples
- Clearly labeled as illustrative scenarios
- Rewritten to remove the personal voice

### Verification Requirements

**Before any content is shared externally, ALL anecdotes/stories must be:**
1. **Research-verified** - With proper citations to published sources, OR
2. **Author-vouched** - Confirmed by the author as their actual experience

**Verification Status Markers:**
- ✓ Verified (research citation provided or author vouched)
- ⚠️ Pending verification
- ❌ AI-generated (needs replacement or removal)

### Replacement Strategy

For AI-generated content, consider:
1. **Published case studies** from psychology/sociology journals
2. **Historical examples** with documented sources
3. **Author's actual experiences** (if relevant and available)
4. **Interview real individuals** (with permission and potentially anonymized)
5. **News stories** that illustrate the concepts
6. **Research study participants** (with appropriate permissions)

### Verification Process

1. **Immediate**: Add source notes to any newly written chapters
2. **Short-term**: Review all existing chapters for source marking
3. **Medium-term**: Begin replacing fictional examples with real ones
4. **Long-term**: Fact-check all concepts and attributions

### Quality Standards

- Every example should be clearly marked as real or illustrative
- All research citations need full references
- Cultural concepts need authentic sources
- Fictional examples should note what they illustrate
- Replacement examples must maintain diversity and relevance
