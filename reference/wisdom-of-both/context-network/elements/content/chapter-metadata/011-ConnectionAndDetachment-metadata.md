## Overview
- **Chapter Summary**: This chapter explores the fundamental paradox between connection and detachmentâ€”our need for deep bonds balanced with the necessity of healthy separation. We examine how different traditions approach this tension and discover that wisdom lies not in choosing intimacy over independence, but in learning to dance between them as each moment requires.
- **Key Concepts**: Secure attachment, healthy boundaries, non-attachment vs. detachment, differentiation, interdependence, digital connection challenges, compassionate boundaries, letting go as love
- **Learning Objectives**: Readers will understand the difference between healthy and unhealthy forms of both connection and detachment, recognize cultural and economic factors that influence attachment patterns, and develop practices for maintaining both intimacy and independence in relationships
- **Connection Points**: Builds on the individual/collective paradox from Chapter 5; relates to action/non-action from Chapter 6; connects with justice/compassion in Chapter 12; culminates in the wisdom of balance explored in Chapter 14
