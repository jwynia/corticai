## Overview
- **Chapter Summary**: This chapter explores the creative tension between justice and compassionâ€”the need for fairness and accountability balanced with mercy and understanding. We examine how wisdom emerges not from choosing law over love or rules over relationships, but from learning to hold both truths simultaneously, allowing each to inform and temper the other.
- **Key Concepts**: Restorative justice, procedural fairness, moral foundations theory, empathy and boundaries, systemic justice, personal mercy, accountability with humanity, transformative justice
- **Learning Objectives**: Readers will understand how justice and compassion complement rather than contradict each other, recognize the dangers of either extreme in isolation, and develop frameworks for navigating situations that demand both fairness and mercy
- **Connection Points**: Builds on the change/stability paradox from Chapter 8; relates to the individual/collective balance from Chapter 5; connects with connection/detachment from Chapter 11; culminates in the wisdom of balance explored in Chapter 14
