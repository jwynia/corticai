## Overview
- **Chapter Summary**: This chapter explores the fundamental paradox between our need for stability and our need for change. We examine how wisdom emerges from understanding that true stability often requires constant adaptation, while meaningful change requires stable foundations. Drawing from resilience science, organizational transformation, and innovation theory, we discover that mastery lies not in choosing stability or change, but in creating dynamic balance between them.
- **Key Concepts**: Dynamic balance, adaptation and preservation, innovation and tradition, resilience frameworks, crisis wisdom, organizational ambidexterity, post-traumatic growth
- **Learning Objectives**: Readers will understand how change and stability are interdependent rather than opposing forces, learn to identify when each is needed, and develop frameworks for navigating transformation while maintaining essential stability
- **Connection Points**: Builds on the wisdom traditions from Chapter 2; connects to the action/non-action paradox from Chapter 5; prepares for the complexity frameworks in Chapter 8
