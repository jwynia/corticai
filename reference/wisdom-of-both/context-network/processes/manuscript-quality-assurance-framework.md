# Manuscript Quality Assurance Framework

## Classification
- **Domain**: Content Quality Control
- **Stability**: Semi-stable (framework may evolve with experience)
- **Abstraction**: Structural (organizational framework)
- **Confidence**: Established (proven through complete statistical verification)

## Overview
Comprehensive framework for ensuring manuscript quality across multiple dimensions, integrating statistical verification with other quality assurance processes.

## Quality Assurance Dimensions

### 1. Statistical Accuracy
- **Process**: [[Statistics Verification Methodology]]
- **Standards**: Primary sources, peer-reviewed research, data currency within 5 years
- **Error Prevention**: [[Statistics Error Patterns]] analysis and prevention
- **Outcome**: All statistical claims verified with authoritative citations

### 2. Citation Integrity
- **Academic Standards**: Full citations with DOI/URL when available
- **Source Hierarchy**: Primary > Secondary > Popular sources
- **Date Verification**: No future-dated citations, recent data preferred
- **Accessibility**: Publicly accessible sources when possible

### 3. Cultural Sensitivity
- **Indigenous Knowledge**: Expert consultation for traditional wisdom claims
- **Cross-Cultural Statistics**: Appropriate cultural context and interpretation
- **Attribution**: Proper recognition of cultural sources and knowledge keepers
- **Representation**: Avoiding misappropriation or oversimplification

### 4. Factual Verification
- **Research Claims**: Verification through academic databases
- **Historical Claims**: Cross-reference with authoritative historical sources
- **Current Events**: Recent and reliable news/report sources
- **Expert Statements**: Direct verification with quoted experts when possible

### 5. Logical Consistency
- **Internal Consistency**: No contradictory claims within manuscript
- **Cross-Chapter Alignment**: Consistent treatment of themes across chapters
- **Argument Coherence**: Logical flow from evidence to conclusions
- **Scope Limitations**: Clear boundaries on claims made

## Quality Assurance Workflow

### Phase 1: Content Creation Quality
1. **Real-time Citation**: Record sources immediately during writing
2. **Claim Verification**: Verify statistics/facts before inclusion
3. **Expert Consultation**: Engage cultural experts for sensitive content
4. **Peer Review**: Chapter-level review by subject matter experts

### Phase 2: Systematic Verification
1. **Statistical Claims**: Complete verification using established methodology
2. **Research Citations**: Academic database verification
3. **Cultural Content**: Cultural sensitivity review
4. **Cross-References**: Internal consistency checking

### Phase 3: Publication Preparation
1. **Citation Formatting**: Standardize all citations to academic format
2. **Source Accessibility**: Ensure cited sources are publicly available
3. **Legal Review**: Copyright and permissions verification
4. **Final Fact-Check**: Comprehensive final review
