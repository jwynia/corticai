# Technical Workflow

## Purpose
This section defines the technical implementation processes, development environment, and technical standards for "The Wisdom of Both" project.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Process
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established

## Structure Overview

This technical workflow is organized into focused, manageable sections:

### Core Components

1. **[Development Environment](environment.md)**
   - Core platform setup and configuration
   - Technical constraints and requirements
   - Required tools and dependencies

2. **[File Management](file-management.md)**
   - File organization standards and procedures
   - Version control and backup processes
   - Content preservation strategies

3. **[Technical Standards](standards.md)**
   - Markdown implementation standards
   - Formatting guidelines and conventions
   - Cross-reference system specifications

4. **[Build Process](build-process.md)**
   - Manuscript compilation workflow
   - Script infrastructure and usage
   - Template management and output generation

5. **[CMS Integration](cms-integration.md)**
   - Content management system architecture
   - Publishing workflow and processes
   - HTML conversion standards

6. **[Quality Assurance](quality-assurance.md)**
   - Technical validation processes
   - Automated checks and testing
   - Content integrity verification

7. **[Maintenance](maintenance.md)**
   - Regular maintenance procedures
   - Troubleshooting and support
   - Future considerations and enhancements

## Quick Reference

### Getting Started
- Review [environment.md](environment.md) for setup requirements
- Check [standards.md](standards.md) for formatting guidelines
- Follow [file_management.md](file-management.md) for organization

### Common Tasks
- **Content Creation:** See [standards.md](standards.md) for formatting
- **Publishing:** Follow [cms_integration.md](cms-integration.md) workflow
- **Validation:** Use [quality_assurance.md](quality-assurance.md) processes
- **Issues:** Consult [maintenance.md](maintenance.md) troubleshooting

## Relationships
- **Parent Nodes:** 
  - [../foundation/structure.md] - implements technical architecture and organizational standards
  - [../foundation/principles.md] - guided by technical principles and quality standards
