# File Management

## Purpose
Defines file organization standards, version control processes, and backup procedures for "The Wisdom of Both" project.

## Classification
- **Domain:** File Organization
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established

## File Organization Standards

### Directory Structure
1. **Hierarchy Principles**
   - Maintain consistent hierarchy across all project areas
   - Use logical grouping and categorization
   - Follow established naming conventions
   - Ensure clear separation of concerns

2. **Structural Guidelines**
   - Group related files in common directories
   - Use descriptive directory names
   - Maintain reasonable depth (avoid excessive nesting)
   - Enable easy navigation and discovery

### Naming Conventions

#### File Naming Standards
1. **Chapter Files**
   - Format: `chapter-XX-descriptive-name.md`
   - Example: `chapter-01-introduction.md`
   - Use zero-padded numbers for proper sorting

2. **Research Files**
   - Format: `research-topic-name.md`
   - Include clear content indication in filename
   - Use descriptive, searchable names

3. **Context Network Files**
   - Follow established context network naming patterns
   - Maintain consistency with existing structure
   - Use clear, descriptive names for easy identification

4. **Supporting Documents**
   - Use lowercase with hyphens for consistency
   - Avoid spaces and special characters
   - Include file type indication when helpful

#### Directory Naming Standards
- Use lowercase with hyphens
- Avoid spaces and special characters
- Use descriptive names that indicate content
- Maintain consistency with project structure

### File Relationships

#### Organization Principles
1. **Parent-Child Relationships**
   - Maintain clear hierarchical relationships
   - Document dependencies between files
   - Use consistent cross-referencing patterns
   - Enable easy navigation and discovery

2. **Connection Documentation**
   - Document file relationships and dependencies
   - Maintain connection maps where helpful
   - Use consistent linking patterns
   - Enable reverse navigation when appropriate

## Version Control Process

### Change Tracking
1. **Modification Documentation**
   - Document all significant modifications in the context network
   - Record decision rationale and implementation context
   - Preserve historical information and evolution tracking
   - Maintain clear change descriptions

2. **Change Management**
   - Use descriptive commit messages when applicable
   - Document the reason for changes
   - Preserve context for future reference
   - Maintain change history integrity

### Content Preservation
1. **Archival Procedures**
   - Archive previous versions before major changes
   - Preserve all existing content during updates
   - Maintain context for why changes were made
   - Verify content integrity after modifications

2. **Recovery Procedures**
   - Maintain clear recovery procedures
   - Test backup and restore processes
   - Document recovery steps and procedures
   - Ensure data integrity during recovery

## Backup Procedures

### Automatic Synchronization
1. **Dropbox Integration**
   - Automatic Dropbox synchronization for all project files
   - Real-time sync across all devices
   - Version history preservation
   - Conflict resolution procedures

2. **Synchronization Monitoring**
   - Regular verification of backup integrity
   - Monitor sync status and resolve conflicts
   - Verify file accessibility across devices
   - Maintain sync consistency

### Local Redundancy
1. **Local Backup Strategy**
   - Local redundancy for critical files
   - Regular local backup procedures
   - Multiple backup locations when possible
   - Backup verification and testing

2. **Recovery Testing**
   - Recovery procedure testing and documentation
   - Regular backup integrity verification
   - Test restore procedures periodically
   - Document recovery success and failures

## File Workflow Procedures

### File Creation Process
1. **Planning Phase**
   - Determine appropriate file location
   - Choose descriptive filename following conventions
   - Plan file relationships and connections
   - Consider integration with existing structure

2. **Creation Phase**
   - Create file in appropriate location
   - Establish initial content structure
   - Add metadata and classification
   - Document relationships and connections

### File Modification Process
1. **Pre-Modification**
   - Review current content and context
   - Plan modification approach
   - Consider impact on related files
   - Backup current version if significant changes

2. **Modification Phase**
   - Make changes following established standards
   - Update cross-references as needed
   - Maintain content integrity
   - Document changes and rationale

3. **Post-Modification**
   - Verify changes and test functionality
   - Update related files as needed
   - Document modifications in context network
   - Verify backup and synchronization

### File Reorganization
1. **Planning Phase**
   - Assess current organization effectiveness
   - Plan new organization structure
   - Consider impact on existing links
   - Document reorganization approach

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Create new directory structure
   - Move files to new locations
   - Update all cross-references and links
   - Test navigation and functionality

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Verify all links and references
   - Test file accessibility
   - Confirm backup synchronization
   - Document reorganization completion
