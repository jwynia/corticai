# Validation Process - MOVED

## Important Notice

**This document has been restructured into a hierarchical format for better navigation and usability.**

### New Location

The validation process documentation is now located in the `validation/` directory:

**→ [validation/index.md](validation/index.md)** - Start here for complete validation documentation

### Why This Change

The original validation.md file was over 400 lines and difficult to navigate. The content has been broken down into focused, manageable documents:

- **[validation/principles.md](validation/principles.md)** - Validation principles and approach
- **[validation/types.md](validation/types.md)** - Four types of validation 
- **[validation/contexts.md](validation/contexts.md)** - Validation contexts and environments
- **[validation/procedures.md](validation/procedures.md)** - Step-by-step validation procedures
- **[validation/strategies.md](validation/strategies.md)** - Specialized validation strategies
- **[validation/tools.md](validation/tools.md)** - Tools, systems, and metrics

### Quick Navigation

- **Planning Validation:** [validation/principles.md](validation/principles.md) → [validation/types.md](validation/types.md)
- **Executing Validation:** [validation/procedures.md](validation/procedures.md) → [validation/strategies.md](validation/strategies.md)
- **Supporting Systems:** [validation/tools.md](validation/tools.md) → [validation/contexts.md](validation/contexts.md)

### Legacy Content

All original content has been preserved and reorganized in the new structure. No information was lost in this restructuring.

## Relationships
- **Parent Nodes:** [processes/creation.md](creation.md)
- **Child Nodes:** [validation/index.md](validation/index.md) - All validation documentation now located in validation directory
- **Related Nodes:** 
  - [processes/delivery/index.md](delivery/index.md) - follows - Delivery follows validation
  - [foundation/principles.md](../foundation/principles.md) - guided-by - Validation follows project principles
  - [foundation/structure.md](../foundation/structure/index.md) - validates - Validation ensures structure is implemented correctly

## Navigation Guidance
- **Access Context:** This is now a redirect document - use [validation/index.md](validation/index.md) for all validation-related activities
- **Common Next Steps:** Go to [validation/index.md](validation/index.md) to access the complete validation documentation
- **Related Tasks:** All validation tasks are now documented in the validation/ directory structure
- **Update Patterns:** This redirect document should remain stable - updates go to the validation/ directory documents
