# Delivery Process

## Purpose
This document provides an overview and navigation hub for the delivery process documentation, including strategies, methods, and best practices.

## Classification

- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Overview

The delivery process encompasses all activities required to move validated deliverables into their intended environments and ensure they function correctly. This includes planning, preparation, execution, validation, and ongoing support.

## Delivery Components

### Core Process Documents
- [[preparation]] - Pre-delivery preparation activities
- [[execution]] - Delivery execution procedures
- [[verification]] - Post-delivery verification and validation
- [[monitoring]] - Ongoing monitoring and support

### Strategy Documents
- [[strategies]] - Delivery strategies (phased, full, canary)
- [[environments]] - Delivery environment configurations
- [[automation]] - Delivery automation and CI/CD

### Supporting Documents
- [[rollback]] - Rollback procedures and testing
- [[documentation]] - Delivery documentation requirements
- [[compliance]] - Compliance and governance requirements

## Delivery Principles

1. **Reliability First**
   Ensure all deliveries are reliable and repeatable

2. **Minimal Disruption**
   Minimize impact on existing operations during delivery

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   Learn from each delivery to improve the process

## Quick Reference
