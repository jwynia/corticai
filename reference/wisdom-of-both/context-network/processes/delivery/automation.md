### Automation Overview

[Describe the approach to delivery automation]

Delivery automation reduces manual effort, increases reliability, and enables faster, more frequent deliveries.

### Continuous Delivery Pipeline

[Describe the continuous delivery pipeline]

#### Pipeline Stages

#### Setup
[Instructions for setting up the continuous delivery pipeline]

#### Usage
[Guidelines for using the continuous delivery pipeline]

### Automation Tools

#### Build Automation
- Build tools and configurations
- Dependency management
- Artifact creation

#### Test Automation
- Unit test execution
- Integration testing
- Performance testing
- Security scanning

#### Deployment Automation
- Infrastructure as code
- Configuration management
- Deployment orchestration
- Environment provisioning

### Pipeline Configuration

#### Triggers
- Code commits
- Pull request merges
- Scheduled builds
- Manual triggers

#### Quality Gates
- Code coverage thresholds
- Test pass rates
- Security scan results
- Performance benchmarks

#### Notifications
- Build status updates
- Deployment notifications
- Failure alerts
- Success confirmations

### Best Practices

#### Version Control
- Pipeline configuration in version control
- Infrastructure definitions versioned
- Rollback capabilities maintained

#### Security
- Secrets management
- Access control
- Audit logging
- Compliance checks

#### Monitoring
- Pipeline performance metrics
- Success/failure rates
- Bottleneck identification
- Continuous improvement
