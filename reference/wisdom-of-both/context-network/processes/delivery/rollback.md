### Rollback Overview

[Describe the procedures for rolling back a delivery if issues are encountered]

Rollback procedures are critical safety mechanisms that allow quick recovery from failed or problematic deliveries.

### Rollback Triggers

[Describe the triggers that would initiate a rollback]

#### Automatic Triggers
- Critical error threshold exceeded
- Performance degradation beyond limits
- Security breach detected
- Data corruption identified

#### Manual Triggers
- Stakeholder decision
- User impact assessment
- Business continuity concerns
- Unexpected behavior reports

### Rollback Process

#### Immediate Actions
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

#### Rollback Execution
1. Halt current delivery process
2. Assess system state
3. Initiate rollback procedure
4. Restore previous version
5. Verify system stability
6. Communicate status

#### Post-Rollback Activities
1. Document rollback reason
2. Analyze root cause
3. Plan remediation
4. Update procedures
5. Schedule retry

### Rollback Strategies

#### Version Rollback
- Revert to previous version
- Database migration reversal
- Configuration restoration

#### Feature Toggle
- Disable problematic features
- Maintain system availability
- Gradual feature rollout

#### Data Rollback
- Restore from backups
- Transaction log replay
- Point-in-time recovery

### Rollback Testing

[Describe how rollback procedures are tested]

#### Test Scenarios
- Planned rollback drills
- Failure injection testing
- Recovery time validation
- Data integrity verification

#### Test Schedule
- Monthly rollback drills
- Pre-deployment testing
- Annual disaster recovery

### Rollback Documentation

Required documentation for each rollback:
- Trigger event details
- Timeline of actions
- Systems affected
- Resolution steps
- Lessons learned
