# Reader Testing Protocol for Fable Collection

## Overview

This protocol structures reader testing to validate collection effectiveness across diverse audiences and use cases. It focuses on gathering specific feedback about both individual fable quality and collection-level coherence.

## Testing Phases

### Phase 1: Individual Fable Validation (Weeks 1-2)
**Purpose**: Validate individual fable quality before collection testing

### Phase 2: Cluster Coherence Testing (Weeks 3-4) 
**Purpose**: Test how well fable groups work together

### Phase 3: Collection Flow Testing (Weeks 5-6)
**Purpose**: Validate different reading paths and overall collection experience

### Phase 4: Integration Testing (Weeks 7-8)
**Purpose**: Test collection's dual function (standalone vs. integrated with main book)
