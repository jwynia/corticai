### Quality Assurance Workflow

#### Stage 1: Self-Assessment
**Creator Responsibilities:**
- Review content against all quality criteria
- Complete relevant checklists
- Address identified issues
- Document areas of uncertainty

**Self-Assessment Process:**
1. Complete content quality checklist
2. Verify technical standards compliance
3. Test all links and cross-references
4. Review for voice and tone consistency
5. Document any concerns or questions

#### Stage 2: Peer Review
**Reviewer Responsibilities:**
- Assess content against quality standards
- Verify accuracy and applicability
- Test technical implementation
- Provide constructive feedback

**Peer Review Process:**
1. Review content for clarity and accuracy
2. Verify practical applicability
3. Check technical implementation
4. Assess integration with existing content
5. Provide specific, actionable feedback

#### Stage 3: Expert Validation
**When Expert Review is Needed:**
- Content addresses specialized topics
- Cultural or traditional knowledge is referenced
- Complex research claims are made
- Professional applications are discussed

**Expert Validation Process:**
1. Subject matter expert reviews content
2. Cultural authenticity is verified (when applicable)
3. Academic accuracy is assessed
4. Professional applicability is validated
5. Recommendations are provided
