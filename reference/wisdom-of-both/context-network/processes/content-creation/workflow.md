## Content Creation Workflow

### Phase 1: Planning and Preparation

#### 1. Chapter Outline Development
- Review research materials and findings
- Identify key concepts and themes
- Structure logical progression of ideas
- Plan integration points with other chapters

#### 2. Research Integration Planning
- Map research findings to chapter sections
- Identify verification needs
- Plan case studies and examples
- Schedule fact-checking activities

#### 3. Template Selection
- Choose appropriate chapter structure template
- Adapt template for specific content needs
- Plan pedagogical elements and exercises
- Consider reader experience and flow

### Phase 2: Content Development

#### 1. Initial Drafting
- Follow established chapter structure template
- Integrate research findings systematically
- Maintain consistent voice and tone
- Include placeholder for exercises and examples

#### 2. Content Expansion
- Develop detailed explanations and examples
- Add case studies and practical applications
- Include reflection prompts and exercises
- Ensure balanced perspective presentation

#### 3. Integration and Cross-Referencing
- Add links to related chapters and concepts
- Ensure consistency with established terminology
- Verify alignment with project principles
- Check narrative coherence and flow

### Phase 3: Review and Refinement

#### 1. Content Review
- Assess clarity and accessibility
- Verify factual accuracy and source attribution
- Check for bias or oversimplification
- Ensure practical applicability

#### 2. Technical Review
- Validate markdown formatting
- Check internal links and cross-references
- Ensure consistent structure and style
- Verify accessibility standards

#### 3. Integration Testing
- Review connections to other chapters
- Test navigation and cross-references
- Assess overall narrative flow
- Validate learning progression

## Workflow Navigation

### Entry Points
- **New Chapter:** Start with Phase 1, Step 1 (Chapter Outline Development)
- **Existing Draft:** Jump to appropriate phase based on current status
- **Review Cycle:** Begin with Phase 3, Step 1 (Content Review)

### Phase Transitions
- **Phase 1 → Phase 2:** Complete when outline is approved and research is mapped
- **Phase 2 → Phase 3:** Complete when content is fully drafted and integrated
- **Phase 3 → Publication:** Complete when all review criteria are met

### Quality Gates
Each phase has specific completion criteria that must be met before advancing:

#### Phase 1 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Comprehensive chapter outline exists
- [ ] Research materials are mapped to sections
- [ ] Template is selected and adapted
- [ ] Integration points are identified

#### Phase 2 Completion Criteria
- [ ] All sections have substantive content
- [ ] Examples and case studies are included
- [ ] Cross-references are established
- [ ] Voice and tone are consistent

#### Phase 3 Completion Criteria
- [ ] Content meets clarity standards
- [ ] Technical formatting is correct
- [ ] All links and references work
- [ ] Integration testing is complete
