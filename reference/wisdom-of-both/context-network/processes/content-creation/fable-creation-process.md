# Fable Creation Process

## Overview

The creation of Paradox Fables requires a specific workflow using specialized Claude Code subagents to ensure quality, consistency, and proper embodiment of paradoxes. This process is mandatory for all fable development.

## Purpose

Paradox Fables must:
- Embody paradoxes rather than explain them
- Maintain productive tension without resolution  
- Allow multiple valid interpretations
- Feel timeless like oral tradition
- Pass rigorous quality criteria

## Required Agent Workflow

### Phase 1: Creation (fable-writer agent)
**Agent**: `fable-writer`  
**Purpose**: Creates fables that embody paradoxes through narrative

**Process**:
1. Provide the agent with:
   - Specific paradox to explore
   - Number of fables needed for cluster (typically 3-4)
   - Different balance ratios/perspectives to show
   - Structural patterns to use (parallel, recursive, dissolution, etc.)
2. Agent creates individual fable files in `manuscript/paradox-fables/fables/`
3. Each fable must follow established quality criteria

### Phase 2: Meta-Narrative (assembler agent)  
**Agent**: `assembler`  
**Purpose**: Creates meta-narrative commentary showing journey of organizing paradoxes

**Process**:
1. Provide agent with completed fables from Phase 1
2. Agent creates assembler notes showing character evolution:
   - Early: Confident categorization attempts
   - Middle: Growing uncertainty as stories resist order
   - Later: Embracing paradox and reader dialogue
3. Creates file in `manuscript/paradox-fables/assembler-notes/`

### Phase 3: Quality Evaluation (fable-critic agent)
**Agent**: `fable-critic`  
**Purpose**: Evaluates fables against quality criteria and provides specific improvements

**Process**:
1. Agent reviews all fables from cluster
2. Tests against quality criteria:
   - Can you remove the paradox and still have the same story? (If yes, not embodied)
   - Does ending feel satisfying despite lacking resolution?
   - Could this be interpreted validly in at least three ways?
   - Does it feel timeless rather than contemporary?
   - Flows like oral tradition when read aloud?
   - Cultural sensitivity check
3. Provides specific improvement suggestions

### Phase 4: Implementation of Improvements (MANDATORY)
**Critical**: The critic's feedback must ALWAYS be applied

**Process**:
1. Review critic's specific suggestions
2. Apply all recommended improvements:
   - Remove over-explanatory notes/asterisked explanations
   - Strengthen archetypal language
   - Replace contemporary dialogue with timeless alternatives
   - Enhance embodiment where needed
3. Do NOT skip this phase - it's essential for quality

## Quality Criteria Checklist

### For Individual Fables
- [ ] Paradox is embodied in story structure, not explained
- [ ] Ending maintains tension without false resolution
- [ ] Multiple valid interpretations possible
- [ ] Language feels archetypal and timeless
- [ ] Reads aloud with oral tradition flow
- [ ] No contemporary references or explanations
- [ ] Cultural sensitivity maintained

### For Fable Clusters  
- [ ] Each fable illuminates different facet of same paradox
- [ ] Together reveal inadequacy of single positions
- [ ] Show different balance ratios appropriately
- [ ] Work as standalone pieces and as group
- [ ] Assembler notes show authentic character evolution

## Common Problems to Avoid

### Over-Explanation
- **Problem**: Adding asterisked explanations after fables
- **Solution**: Let paradox speak through narrative alone
- **Example**: Remove "Paradox embodied: X means Y" notes

### Contemporary Language  
- **Problem**: Modern phrases that break timeless feel
- **Solution**: Use archetypal, traditional dialogue patterns
- **Example**: "The race means nothing" → "I will take my time and see what comes"

### Forced Resolution
- **Problem**: Endings that resolve paradox instead of maintaining tension
- **Solution**: End with productive uncertainty or cycling questions

### Insufficient Embodiment
- **Problem**: Paradox described rather than lived through story
- **Solution**: Make paradox inseparable from narrative structure

## File Organization

```
manuscript/paradox-fables/
├── fables/                      # Original fables with metadata
│   ├── [paradox-cluster-name]/
│   │   ├── fable-1.md
│   │   ├── fable-2.md
│   │   └── fable-3.md

```

### Critical File Format Differences

**IMPORTANT**: Files must follow different formats depending on location:

#### Files in `/fables/` directories:
- **Include structural headers**: `## Core Paradox`, `## The Fable`
- **Include metadata**: Paradox description, classification notes
- **Purpose**: Reference and analysis

#### Files in `/sequence/` directory:
- **NO structural headers**: Start directly with narrative after title
- **NO metadata**: Clean narrative only
- **Purpose**: Compilation into final document

**Example Comparison:**

*In `/fables/certainty-doubt/the-lens-maker.md`:*
```markdown
# The Lens Maker

## Core Paradox
Truth appears opposite at different scales of examination

## The Fable

There once was a lens maker...
```

*In `/sequence/041.5-lens-maker.md`:*
```markdown
# The Lens Maker

There once was a lens maker...
```

### Integration Workflow
When moving fables to sequence:
1. Copy story content from `/fables/` version
2. Remove ALL structural headers (Core Paradox, The Fable, etc.)
3. Keep only title and narrative
4. Use numerical prefix for proper ordering (e.g., `041.5-lens-maker.md`)

## Success Indicators

### Immediate Quality Tests
- Reader can discover multiple meanings on different readings
- Story feels "found" rather than constructed  
- Removing paradox would fundamentally change the story
- Language sounds like it could be ancient wisdom

### Long-term Success Measures
- Stories quoted from memory
- "I'm having a [fable name] moment" enters vocabulary
- Multiple interpretations emerge in discussions
- Readers return with fresh discoveries

## Integration with Main Book

Fables created through this process will be:
- Strategically placed as chapter openers
- Used as transition spaces between analytical sections
- Selected for dual use based on specific criteria
- Cross-referenced between collection and main book

## Maintenance and Updates

- Document any process improvements discovered during creation
- Track which structural patterns work best for different paradoxes  
- Maintain list of successful archetypal language patterns
- Record reader feedback for future quality improvements

## Next Steps After Process Completion

1. Update context network with cluster completion
2. Test fables with readers for interpretation validation  
3. Identify integration points in main book chapters
4. Plan next cluster based on main book priorities
