# Writing Standards and Guidelines

## Purpose
This document establishes the voice, tone, and language standards for creating consistent, engaging content in "The Wisdom of Both" project.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Process/Standards
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established

## Writing Standards and Guidelines

### Voice and Tone

#### 1. Authoritative but Humble
- Demonstrate knowledge while acknowledging limitations
- Avoid dogmatic or prescriptive language
- Encourage exploration and personal discovery
- Model the paradoxical thinking being taught

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Research suggests that..." rather than "Studies prove that..."
- ✅ "One approach to consider..." rather than "The solution is..."
- ✅ "This perspective offers..." rather than "This is the truth..."

#### 2. Engaging and Accessible
- Use storytelling and narrative elements
- Include personal reflection and vulnerability
- Connect with reader experiences and challenges
- Maintain warmth and approachability

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Like many people, you might find yourself..." 
- ✅ "Consider Sarah's experience with this dilemma..."
- ✅ "We've all faced moments when..."

#### 3. Consistent Style
- Follow established tone guide principles
- Maintain consistent voice throughout chapters
- Use parallel structure and formatting
- Ensure smooth transitions between concepts

**Examples:**
- ✅ Consistent use of second person ("you") for direct engagement
- ✅ Parallel structure in lists and examples
- ✅ Smooth transitions: "Having explored X, we now turn to Y..."

### Language and Style Guidelines

#### 1. Clarity and Precision
- Use clear, concrete language
- Define technical terms and concepts
- Provide examples and illustrations
- Avoid unnecessary complexity

**Clarity Checklist:**
- [ ] Can a general reader understand this concept?
- [ ] Are abstract ideas supported with concrete examples?
- [ ] Are technical terms defined when first introduced?
- [ ] Is sentence structure varied but clear?

#### 2. Inclusive and Respectful
- Use inclusive language and examples
- Respect diverse perspectives and traditions
- Avoid cultural stereotypes or assumptions
- Acknowledge different backgrounds and experiences

**Inclusivity Guidelines:**
- Use diverse names and cultural references in examples
- Acknowledge multiple valid approaches to challenges
- Avoid assuming specific cultural or religious backgrounds
- Include various life circumstances and perspectives

#### 3. Active and Engaging
- Use active voice when possible
- Vary sentence structure and length
- Include rhetorical questions and direct address
- Maintain reader engagement throughout

**Engagement Techniques:**
- ✅ "How might you approach this situation?"
- ✅ "Consider the last time you experienced..."
- ✅ "What if we looked at this differently?"

## Language Patterns

### Paradoxical Language
- Use "both/and" construction rather than "either/or"
- Acknowledge complexity and nuance
- Avoid oversimplification of difficult concepts
- Model paradoxical thinking in language choices

**Examples:**
- ✅ "Both perspectives offer valuable insights"
- ✅ "This approach is simultaneously challenging and rewarding"
- ✅ "We can hold these truths together"

### Respectful Attribution
- Acknowledge wisdom traditions and sources
- Use respectful language when discussing different cultures
- Avoid appropriation or superficial treatment
- Give credit where credit is due

**Attribution Standards:**
- Name specific traditions when drawing from them
- Acknowledge the depth and complexity of wisdom traditions
- Avoid treating practices as mere techniques
- Include diverse sources and perspectives

### Practical Application Language
- Use actionable language for exercises and applications
- Provide specific, concrete guidance
- Balance challenge with support
- Encourage experimentation and personal adaptation

**Application Language:**
- ✅ "Try this approach for one week..."
- ✅ "Notice what happens when you..."
- ✅ "Experiment with different responses..."

## Common Language Pitfalls

### Avoid These Patterns
- **Absolute statements**: "Always," "never," "all," "none"
- **Oversimplification**: "Simply," "just," "merely"
- **Judgment language**: "Good/bad," "right/wrong," "should/shouldn't"
- **Cultural assumptions**: Assuming specific backgrounds or experiences

### Replace With
- **Qualified statements**: "Often," "typically," "many," "some"
- **Nuanced language**: "Complex," "multifaceted," "varies"
- **Descriptive language**: "Helpful/challenging," "effective/ineffective"
- **Inclusive language**: "Some people," "in certain contexts," "various approaches"

## Style Consistency

### Formatting Consistency
- Use consistent formatting for similar elements
- Maintain parallel structure in lists and examples
- Apply formatting rules uniformly throughout
- Ensure visual hierarchy supports content structure

### Terminology Consistency
