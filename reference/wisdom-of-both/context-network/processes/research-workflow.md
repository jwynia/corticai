### Research Command Usage

#### Basic Research Query
To run a research query, use the following command from within the research directory:

```bash
research "Your research question here?"
```

For example:
```bash
cd research && research "How do different cultures balance individual autonomy with collective responsibility?"
```

#### Advanced Query Techniques
1. **Specific Time Periods**
   - Include temporal context in queries
   - Example: "Recent neuroscience research on wisdom (2020-2024)"

2. **Cross-Cultural Focus**
   - Specify cultural contexts or comparative approaches
   - Example: "Eastern vs Western approaches to paradoxical thinking"

3. **Interdisciplinary Queries**
   - Combine multiple fields for comprehensive coverage
   - Example: "Psychology and philosophy perspectives on cognitive flexibility"

### Output Management

#### File Organization
- **Output Location**: Research command generates markdown files in `research/output/` directory
- **Naming Convention**: Timestamp and UUID format (e.g., `2025-04-03-03-09-45-344a29b2-9ec3-49ab-85af-7e190ba239c0.md`)
- **Processing Required**: Files must be copied and renamed for proper organization

#### Organization Process
After running research queries, follow this workflow:

1. **Review Output**
   - Examine generated content in `research/output/`
   - Assess quality and relevance of findings
   - Identify key insights and patterns

2. **Copy and Rename**
   - Copy files from output directory to appropriate chapter or topic directory
   - Use descriptive filenames that reflect content
   - Example:
   ```bash
   cp research/output/2025-04-03-03-09-45-344a29b2-9ec3-49ab-85af-7e190ba239c0.md research/by-chapter/ch4-individual-and-collective/cultural-balance-autonomy-responsibility.md
   ```

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Record research activity in research log
   - Update relevant index files
   - Note integration points for manuscript
