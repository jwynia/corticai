# Statistical Accuracy Standards

## Classification
- **Domain**: Content Quality Control
- **Stability**: Static (fundamental standards unlikely to change)
- **Abstraction**: Detailed (specific implementation standards)
- **Confidence**: Established (proven through 34 statistical claim verifications)

## Overview
Comprehensive standards for statistical accuracy in academic and popular writing, developed through systematic verification of manuscript statistical claims.

## Verification Standards Hierarchy

### Tier 1: Authoritative Sources (Required)
1. **Peer-Reviewed Academic Research**
   - Primary preference for all statistical claims
   - Must include methodology and sample size when relevant
   - Recent research preferred (within 5-10 years)
   - High-impact journals prioritized

2. **Official Government Statistics**
   - National statistics offices and census data
   - International organizations (UN, World Bank, WHO, ILO)
   - Government ministry reports and surveys
   - Must include data collection year and methodology

3. **Recognized International Organizations**
   - Professional associations with research arms
   - Established NGOs with statistical programs
   - Industry organizations with authoritative data
   - Must have transparent methodology

### Tier 2: Secondary Sources (Acceptable with Caution)
1. **Reputable News Organizations**
   - Only when reporting on primary sources
   - Must trace back to original source when possible
   - Quality outlets with fact-checking standards
   - Recent reporting preferred

2. **Academic Books and Monographs**
   - When citing original research or synthesis
   - Must check original sources when available
   - Preference for university press publications
   - Recent editions prioritized

### Tier 3: Tertiary Sources (Avoid When Possible)
1. **Popular Books and Media**
   - Only when primary sources unavailable
   - Must verify through independent sources
   - Note limitations in manuscript
   - Use qualifying language ("reported," "claimed")

## Citation Requirements

### Essential Elements
1. **Complete Source Information**
   - Author(s), publication year, title
   - Journal/publisher name, volume/issue numbers
   - DOI or URL when available
   - Page numbers for specific claims

2. **Temporal Context**
   - Year of data collection (not just publication)
   - Period covered by statistics (ranges, specific years)
   - Currency indicators ("as of 2024," "in 2023")
   - Frequency of data collection when relevant

3. **Methodological Context**
   - Sample size for survey data
   - Geographic scope (national, regional, local)
   - Population defined (adults, households, organizations)
   - Limitations noted when significant

### Data Currency Standards
- **Social Statistics**: Prefer data within 5 years
- **Economic Data**: Prefer data within 3 years  
- **Technology Statistics**: Prefer data within 2 years
- **Cultural/Historical Data**: Assess relevance of timeframe
- **Scientific Research**: Recent findings preferred, landmark studies acceptable

## Accuracy Thresholds

### Acceptable Variance Levels
- **Large-Scale Statistics** (millions): ±5% acceptable
- **Percentage Claims**: ±3 percentage points acceptable
- **Growth Rates**: ±2% acceptable
- **Comparative Claims**: Must use same time period and methodology

### Precision Requirements
- **Round Numbers**: Likely estimates requiring "approximately"
- **Specific Percentages**: Require exact source verification
- **Decimal Precision**: Match precision of original source
- **Range Estimates**: Prefer ranges when exact figures unavailable

## Error Classification and Response

### Type 1: Fabricated Claims ❌ ZERO TOLERANCE
- **Definition**: Claims with no supporting evidence
- **Response**: Remove entirely or replace with verifiable alternative
- **Examples**: Future-dated citations, impossible statistics
- **Prevention**: Systematic source verification

### Type 2: Significantly Overstated Claims ⚠️ REQUIRES CORRECTION
- **Definition**: Claims exceeding credible evidence by >25%
- **Response**: Correct to accurate figure with proper qualification
- **Examples**: "50% reduction" when actual is "6-15% reduction"
- **Prevention**: Multiple source verification for dramatic claims

### Type 3: Outdated Statistics ⏳ UPDATE PREFERRED
- **Definition**: Accurate when published but superseded
- **Response**: Update to most recent available data
- **Examples**: Membership numbers, economic indicators
- **Prevention**: Regular currency checks

### Type 4: Unverifiable Specifics ❓ QUALIFY OR GENERALIZE
- **Definition**: Specific figures lacking supporting documentation
- **Response**: Use qualifying language or convert to general statement
- **Examples**: "68% work multiple jobs" → "many work multiple jobs"
- **Prevention**: Source documentation during writing

## Quality Control Procedures

### Verification Workflow
1. **Source Identification**: Locate primary or authoritative source
2. **Accuracy Assessment**: Compare claim to source data
3. **Currency Check**: Verify data recency and relevance
4. **Context Verification**: Ensure appropriate use and interpretation
5. **Citation Completion**: Full bibliographic information
6. **Cross-Reference**: Check for consistency across manuscript

### Red Flag Indicators
- **Round Percentages**: 10%, 25%, 50%, 75% require extra scrutiny
- **Dramatic Claims**: Large effect sizes (>40% improvements)
- **Popular Statistics**: Widely cited figures without clear origin
- **Future Dates**: Any citations dated after current year
- **Missing Context**: Statistics without geographic/temporal scope

### Cultural Sensitivity Protocols
- **Indigenous Statistics**: Require cultural expert consultation
- **Cross-Cultural Comparisons**: Must account for cultural context
- **Traditional Knowledge**: Respect cultural protocols for sharing
- **Historical Claims**: Consider colonial/post-colonial perspectives

## Domain-Specific Standards

### Business and Economics
- **Financial Data**: Verify currency and accounting standards
- **Performance Metrics**: Ensure methodology transparency
- **Industry Statistics**: Cross-check with multiple industry sources
- **Case Studies**: Harvard Business School and similar institutional sources preferred

### Health and Psychology
- **Clinical Research**: Peer-review required, sample sizes noted
- **Survey Data**: Methodology and representative samples essential
- **Mental Health**: Sensitive handling of statistics
- **Public Health**: WHO, CDC, and national health agencies preferred

### Social and Cultural Statistics
- **Demographic Data**: Census and official survey sources
- **Cultural Practices**: Community consultation and respectful representation
- **Global Comparisons**: Account for measurement differences
- **Historical Data**: Multiple source verification when possible

### Justice and Legal Systems
- **Court Statistics**: Official court system data
- **Recidivism Rates**: Standardized measurement periods
- **International Comparisons**: Account for legal system differences
- **Human Rights Data**: UN and established NGO sources

## Implementation Guidelines

2. **Source Documentation**: Record full citations immediately
3. **Claim Moderation**: Use qualifying language for uncertain data
4. **Expert Consultation**: Engage specialists for technical claims

### For Existing Content
1. **Systematic Review**: Check every statistical claim
2. **Priority Assessment**: Focus on high-impact statistics first
3. **Correction Documentation**: Track all changes and rationale
4. **Consistency Check**: Ensure alignment across chapters

### For Future Maintenance
1. **Regular Updates**: Annual review of time-sensitive statistics
2. **Source Monitoring**: Track changes to frequently cited sources
3. **Feedback Integration**: Address reader-reported inaccuracies
4. **Standard Evolution**: Update standards based on new best practices
