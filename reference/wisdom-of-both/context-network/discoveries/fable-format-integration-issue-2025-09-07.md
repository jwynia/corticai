# Discovery: Fable Format Integration Issue

## Date
2025-09-07

## Context
Adding "The Lens Maker" fable to the sequence revealed a systematic file format issue.

## Problem Found
**Location**: `manuscript/paradox-fables/sequence/041.5-lens-maker.md`
**Issue**: File included structural headers from `/fables/` directory format

**Original (incorrect):**
```markdown
# The Lens Maker

## Core Paradox
Truth appears opposite at different scales of examination

## The Fable

There once was a lens maker...
```

**Corrected:**
```markdown
# The Lens Maker

There once was a lens maker...
```

## Root Cause
**Missing Documentation**: No clear guidance on file format differences between:
- `/fables/` directories (with metadata headers)  
- `/sequence/` directory (narrative only)

## Pattern Discovered
This type of formatting error will occur whenever:
1. Fables are copied from `/fables/` to `/sequence/` 
2. Person doing integration doesn't know format requirements
3. Compilation scripts can't catch structural header issues

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Process Documentation Enhanced
**File**: `context-network/processes/content-creation/fable-creation-process.md`
**Addition**: Complete section on "Critical File Format Differences" with examples

### 2. CLAUDE.md Warning Added  
**File**: `CLAUDE.md`
**Addition**: "Critical: Paradox Fable File Formats" section in Prohibited Practices

### 3. Integration Workflow Documented
**Steps added**:
1. Copy story content from `/fables/` version
2. Remove ALL structural headers (Core Paradox, The Fable, etc.)
3. Keep only title and narrative  
4. Use numerical prefix for ordering

## Prevention Measures
- Format requirements now documented in two locations
- Clear examples provided for both formats
- Integration workflow explicitly defined
- Warning prominently placed in CLAUDE.md

## Related Issues
- Compilation script order mismatches (resolved same session)
- Missing assembler note updates (resolved same session)

## Lessons Learned
1. **File format differences must be documented explicitly**
2. **Integration workflows need step-by-step instructions**  
3. **Examples prevent misunderstanding better than descriptions**
4. **Multiple documentation locations help catch edge cases**

## Follow-up Actions
- Monitor future fable integrations for format compliance
- Consider adding format validation to compilation scripts
- Update onboarding to emphasize format requirements

## Significance
This discovery prevents future compilation issues and ensures consistent formatting across the fable collection. The documentation improvements will help anyone working with fables avoid this systematic error.
