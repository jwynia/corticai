# Decisions

Key project decisions, rationale, and decision-making frameworks.

## Overview

This section tracks significant decisions made throughout the project lifecycle, providing transparency and context for current and future team members.

## Decision Records

### Templates and Framework
- [Decision Template](decision-template.md) - Standard template for recording decisions
- [Decision Index](decision-index.md) - Master index of all recorded decisions

## Decision Categories

*As decisions are recorded, they will be organized into categories such as:*
- Architecture and Structure
- Content Strategy
- Process and Workflow
- Technical Implementation
- Resource Allocation

## Navigation

- **Up:** [Context Network](../index.md)
- **Related:** [Foundation](../foundation/index.md)

## Recording New Decisions

1. Use the [Decision Template](decision-template.md) to structure new decision records
2. Update the [Decision Index](decision-index.md) with the new decision
3. Link related decisions and reference relevant foundation documents
4. Consider impacts on [Planning](../planning/index.md) and [Processes](../processes/index.md)
