# Front-End Task Backlog Planning Summary

## Overview
Comprehensive front-end development backlog created for the Pliers platform, focusing on React SPA implementation with form-driven architecture patterns.

## Tasks Created

### Foundation Layer (Epic: web-foundation)
1. **WEB-001** - React SPA Foundation with Vite *(already existed)*
   - Modern React 18+ setup with TypeScript
   - Vite build system and development environment
   - Routing, state management, and theme system

2. **WEB-002** - Design System and Component Library
   - Tailwind CSS + Radix UI component foundation
   - Accessibility-first design system
   - Dark/light theme support with Storybook documentation

3. **WEB-003** - API Client Integration and State Management
   - React Query for server state management
   - Authentication token handling
   - WebSocket integration for real-time updates

### Forms Layer (Epic: web-forms)
4. **WEB-004** - Dynamic Form Renderer Engine
   - JSON schema to React form rendering
   - All field types with validation
   - Conditional logic and relationship support

5. **WEB-005** - Form Designer Interface
   - Drag-and-drop form builder
   - Visual conditional logic editor
   - Form templates and preview system

### Dashboard Layer (Epic: web-dashboard)
6. **WEB-006** - Dashboard Layout and Widget System
   - Grid-based dashboard with drag-and-drop
   - Widget library (charts, metrics, tables)
   - Real-time data visualization

### Authentication Layer (Epic: web-auth)
7. **WEB-007** - Authentication Interface and User Experience
   - Multi-method authentication UI (passkeys, magic links, passwords)
   - Device capability detection
   - User onboarding and account management

## Architecture Decisions

### Technology Stack
- **React 18+** with concurrent features
- **Vite** for fast development builds
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS + Radix UI** for design system
- **React Query** for state management
- **React Hook Form** for form handling

### Design Patterns
- **Form-driven development** - UI follows backend form patterns
- **Component composition** - Flexible, reusable components
- **Progressive enhancement** - Works across device capabilities
- **Real-time updates** - WebSocket integration throughout

### Accessibility & Performance
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all components
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Performance targets: FCP < 1.5s, LCP < 2.5s
- Progressive web app capabilities

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (WEB-001, WEB-002, WEB-003)
Establish core infrastructure, design system, and API integration. This provides the foundation for all subsequent development.

### Phase 2: Form System (WEB-004, WEB-005)
Build the form rendering and designer capabilities. This enables the form-driven architecture pattern throughout the application.

### Phase 3: Dashboard System (WEB-006)
Create the dashboard and visualization system. This provides data insights and analytics capabilities.

### Phase 4: Authentication (WEB-007)
Implement comprehensive authentication interfaces. This completes the user-facing authentication experience.

## Dependencies and Risks

### Critical Dependencies
- Backend authentication system (AUTH-001, AUTH-004, AUTH-005)
- Form Engine specification (DOC-002-8)
- Event Engine for real-time updates

### Key Risks Identified
1. **Technology Integration** - React Query + WebSocket coordination
2. **Form Complexity** - Dynamic rendering performance with large forms
3. **Authentication UX** - WebAuthn browser compatibility
4. **Dashboard Performance** - Real-time updates with many widgets

### Mitigation Strategies
- Prototype complex integrations early
- Implement performance monitoring from start
- Progressive enhancement for authentication methods
- Optimize rendering with virtualization and memoization

## Success Metrics

### Developer Experience
- Component library adoption rate
- Form development velocity
- Code reuse across features

### User Experience
- Authentication success rates
- Form completion rates
- Dashboard engagement metrics
- Accessibility compliance scores

### Technical Performance
- Bundle size < 300KB gzipped
- First Contentful Paint < 1.5s
- Lighthouse scores > 90

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Groom foundation tasks (WEB-001, WEB-002, WEB-003)
2. **Sprint 1**: Implement React SPA foundation and design system
3. **Sprint 2**: Build API client and form renderer
4. **Sprint 3**: Create form designer interface
5. **Sprint 4**: Implement dashboard system
6. **Sprint 5**: Complete authentication interfaces

## Files Created
- 6 new task files (WEB-002 through WEB-007)
- 4 epic index files (web-foundation, web-forms, web-dashboard, web-auth)
- Architecture documentation
- Updated planned tasks index

## Backlog Status
- **Total Front-End Tasks**: 7 (including existing WEB-001)
- **Status**: All tasks in planned state, ready for grooming
- **Estimated Effort**: 6 large tasks, 1 medium task
- **Priority Distribution**: 5 high, 1 medium, 1 foundational

The front-end backlog is now comprehensive and ready for implementation, providing a clear path from basic React setup to full-featured web application supporting the Pliers form-driven architecture.
