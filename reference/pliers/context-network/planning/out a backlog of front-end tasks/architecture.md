# Front-End Architecture Plan

## Overview
The Pliers front-end will be a React SPA that interfaces with the form-driven backend architecture. The UI will be built around the core principle that all features are implemented as form types.

## Core Architecture Principles

### 1. Form-Centric UI Design
- All admin interfaces are forms rendered by the form engine
- Data display uses the same form definitions for consistency
- Configuration screens leverage form field types (color pickers, file uploads, etc.)

### 2. Component Architecture
```
Components/
├── Foundation/          # Base components (Button, Input, Layout)
├── Forms/              # Form rendering engine
│   ├── Fields/         # Field type components
│   ├── Validation/     # Form validation UI
│   └── Renderer/       # Dynamic form renderer
├── Dashboard/          # Dashboard and analytics
├── Auth/              # Authentication interfaces
└── Admin/             # System administration
```

### 3. State Management
- React Context + useReducer for global state
- React Query for server state management
- Local state for form interactions and UI state

### 4. Design System
- Consistent component library
- Dark/light theme support
- Accessibility-first design
- Mobile-responsive layouts

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **React 18+** with concurrent features
- **Vite** for fast development and building
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React Router** for client-side routing

### State & Data
- **React Query (TanStack Query)** for server state
- **React Context** for global UI state
- **React Hook Form** for form state management

### Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Radix UI** for accessible component primitives
- **Lucide React** for consistent iconography

### Development Tools
- **ESLint + Prettier** for code quality
- **Vitest** for unit testing
- **React Testing Library** for component testing
- **Storybook** for component development

## Key Features to Implement

### 1. Form System UI
- Dynamic form renderer from JSON schema
- Field components for all supported types
- Form validation and error display
- Form designer interface

### 2. Dashboard System
- Widget-based dashboard layout
- Configurable charts and visualizations
- Real-time data updates via WebSocket
- Export and sharing capabilities

### 3. Authentication Interface
- Multi-method authentication (passkey, magic link, password)
- Device capability detection
- Onboarding flows
- Account management

### 4. Admin Interface
- System configuration forms
- User management
- Plugin configuration
- Analytics and monitoring

## Implementation Strategy

2. Implement routing and layout structure
3. Create design system foundations
4. Set up authentication context

### Phase 2: Form Engine UI
1. Build dynamic form renderer
2. Implement all field type components
3. Add form validation UI
4. Create form designer interface

### Phase 3: Dashboard System
1. Build dashboard layout system
2. Implement chart components
3. Add real-time data integration
4. Create widget configuration UI

### Phase 4: Authentication UI
1. Implement login/register flows
2. Add multi-method authentication
3. Build onboarding experiences
4. Create account management

### Phase 5: Admin Interface
1. Build system configuration UI
2. Add user management interface
3. Implement plugin management
4. Create monitoring dashboards
