### Release Strategy

**Agent-First Development Approach**: All implementation work will be performed by LLM agents working from comprehensive task specifications developed during Phase 1.

- **Versioning**: Semantic versioning (v3.0.0) with pre-release tags during development phases
- **Release Frequency**: Monthly alpha releases during active development phases for feedback
- **Deployment**: Containerized deployment with Docker, targeting cloud-native infrastructure
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive automated testing implemented by agents alongside feature development
- **Documentation**: Living documentation generated from code and updated by development agents

### Resource Allocation

**Phase 1 (Foundation)**: 100% planning and documentation effort
- Context network development and architectural planning
- Comprehensive task specification and workflow design
- No implementation resources required

**Phase 2-4 (Development)**: 100% LLM agent implementation
- Task execution by AI agents working from detailed specifications
- Human oversight for architecture validation and quality assurance
- Minimal direct coding effort required from human stakeholders

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| LLM Agent Limitations | High | Medium | Comprehensive task specification, iterative approach, human oversight |
| Architecture Complexity | High | Medium | Detailed planning phase, phased implementation, regular validation |
| Technology Stack Maturity | Medium | Low | Proven technology choices, fallback options documented |
| Scope Creep | Medium | Medium | Clear phase boundaries, documentation-first approach, regular reviews |
| Context Network Quality | High | Low | Extensive review process, continuous refinement, stakeholder validation |
| Plugin System Complexity | High | **Low** | **Middleware composition pattern (Hono-inspired), simpler than traditional plugins** |
| Event Ordering Issues | High | **Low** | **Aggregate versioning, outbox pattern, LISTEN/NOTIFY for real-time** |
| Multi-tenant Data Leakage | **Critical** | **Very Low** | **PostgreSQL RLS from day one, automated isolation testing** |
| Performance Degradation | Medium | Medium | **CQRS with denormalized read models, event stream partitioning** |

### Research-Informed Technical Decisions (2025-09-23)

Based on comprehensive technical research, the following architectural decisions are recommended:

#### Database & Storage
- **Event Store**: PostgreSQL with transactional outbox pattern for reliability
- **JSONB Validation**: CHECK constraints with jsonb_typeof and custom validation functions
- **Multi-tenancy**: Row-Level Security (RLS) enabled from Phase 1
- **Read Models**: Denormalized projections for CQRS (10x-1000x performance gains)

#### Architecture Patterns
- **Plugin System**: Middleware composition (Hono-inspired) instead of traditional plugins
- **Saga Implementation**: Start with choreography, add orchestration for complex workflows
- **Event Publishing**: PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY for real-time notifications
- **Event Serialization**: Default to JSONB for flexibility, optimize later if needed

#### Security & Compliance
- **Tenant Isolation**: Database-enforced RLS with session variables
- **Audit Trail**: Immutable event log with integrity protection
- **Performance**: Indexed tenant_id columns, connection pooling considerations

See [Technical Research Findings](../../discoveries/records/2025-09-23-technical-research.md) for detailed implementation patterns.
