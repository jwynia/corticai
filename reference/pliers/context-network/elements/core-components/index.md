## Component Relationships

### Data Flow
```
Form Definition → Form Submission → Event Generation → Plugin Processing
                                 ↓
Status Management ← Workflow Engine ← Event Processing
                                 ↓
Search Indexing ← Query Processing ← AI Analysis
```

### Dependencies
- **Form Engine**: Foundation for all other components
- **Event Engine**: Central coordination for all system actions
- **Plugin Engine**: Extends functionality across all components
- **AI Engine**: Enhances capabilities across form, workflow, and search components

### Integration Points
- Form definitions drive workflow status options
- Form submissions trigger event processing
- Events drive plugin execution and AI analysis
- Search queries are defined using form definitions
- AI services enhance form design and workflow automation

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 2 (Core Engine)
1. **Form Engine** - Foundation component, highest priority
2. **Submission Engine** - Core data management
3. **Event Engine** - Basic event processing
4. **Status Management** - Simple workflow support

### Phase 3 (Advanced Features)
1. **Plugin Engine** - Extensibility framework
2. **Workflow Engine** - Advanced workflow orchestration
3. **Search Engine** - Advanced query capabilities
4. **Query Builder** - Dashboard and reporting

### Phase 4 (AI Integration)
1. **AI Engine** - Core AI service coordination
2. **AI Form Assistant** - AI-enhanced form design
3. **AI Workflow Enhancement** - Intelligent automation
4. **AI Search Enhancement** - Semantic search capabilities

## Design Principles

### Modularity
Each component is designed as a discrete module with clear interfaces and minimal coupling.

### Extensibility
Plugin architecture allows extension of core functionality without modifying core components.

### Type Safety
All components use TypeScript with Zod validation for runtime type safety.

### Event-Driven
All component interactions flow through the event system for observability and plugin processing.

### AI-Enhanced
Every component includes integration points for AI enhancement and automation.
