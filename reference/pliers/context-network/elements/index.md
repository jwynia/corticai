## Purpose
This section contains domain-specific information about Pliers components, organized by category for easy navigation and reference.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Supporting Element
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Elements Structure

### Architecture
Core system design and technical architecture components.

- **[modern_design.md](architecture/modern_design.md)** - Overall modern architecture design
- **[data_storage.md](architecture/data_storage.md)** - Database design and storage patterns
- **[plugin_system.md](architecture/plugin_system.md)** - Plugin architecture and management
- **[ai_integration.md](architecture/ai_integration.md)** - AI service integration patterns
- **[event_system.md](architecture/event_system.md)** - Event processing and streaming design

### Core Components
Essential system components and their specifications.

- **Form Engine** - Form definition and submission management
- **Workflow Engine** - Status management and workflow orchestration
- **Search Engine** - Query system and search capabilities
- **Plugin Engine** - Plugin lifecycle and execution management
- **AI Engine** - AI service coordination and enhancement features

### Data Models
Data structures, schemas, and relationship definitions.

- **Form Definitions** - Schema for form structure and validation
- **Form Submissions** - Data storage and retrieval patterns
- **Relationships** - Inter-form relationship modeling
- **Events** - Event schema and type definitions
- **User Management** - Authentication and authorization models

### Integrations
External system integrations and API specifications.

- **Database Integration** - PostgreSQL patterns and optimization
- **AI Service Integration** - LLM API integration patterns
- **Monitoring Integration** - Observability and logging patterns
- **Authentication Integration** - Identity provider integration

### Deployment
Infrastructure and deployment-related components.

- **Container Architecture** - Docker and orchestration patterns
- **Cloud Architecture** - Cloud-native deployment strategies
- **Security Architecture** - Security patterns and implementations
- **Performance Architecture** - Optimization and scaling patterns

## Navigation Guidelines

### For System Understanding
1. Start with `architecture/modern_design.md` for overall system design
2. Review specific component documentation in relevant categories
3. Check integration patterns for external system coordination

### For Implementation Planning
1. Review architecture documents for technical specifications
2. Examine data models for schema definitions
3. Study deployment patterns for infrastructure requirements

### For Component Development
1. Reference core component specifications
2. Review integration patterns for dependency management
3. Check architectural patterns for design consistency

## Relationships
- **Parent Nodes:** [discovery.md] - organizes - Elements organized within overall context network
- **Child Nodes:** [Category directories] - contains - Specific element categories and items
- **Related Nodes:**
