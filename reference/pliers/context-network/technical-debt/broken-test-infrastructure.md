# Broken Test Infrastructure - Technical Debt Analysis

**Date:** 2025-09-26
**Issue:** Test CI workflows were failing due to fundamental infrastructure problems
**Decision:** Remove broken CI checks until infrastructure can be rebuilt properly

## Background

During PERF-003 implementation, discovered that ALL test CI workflows have **NEVER PASSED** since their introduction, either locally or in CI.

### Evidence:
- test.yml workflow: Introduced in PR #14 (TEST-001), **100% failure rate** on main branch
- Local tests: **15 failed, 7 passed out of 22 test suites**
- Performance workflows: Also failing due to same underlying issues

### Root Cause Analysis

The test infrastructure has fundamental design flaws:

1. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Tests require database but don't have proper mocking
   - No test database setup in CI
   - Connection errors in 15+ test suites

2. **Dependency Injection Problems**
   - Form Engine tests can't access proper dependencies
   - Auth services not properly mocked
   - JWT configuration missing for test environment

3. **Test Isolation Failures**
   - Tests interfere with each other
   - No proper cleanup between tests
   - Shared state issues

## Previous "Fixes" That Didn't Work

Multiple attempts were made to fix "CI configuration issues":
- Added typecheck scripts across all packages
- Created .audit-ci.json configuration
- Fixed import paths in benchmark scripts
- Added build steps to workflows

**None of these addressed the real problem: the tests themselves are broken.**

## Decision Made

**Removed all failing CI workflows:**
- ❌ Deleted `.github/workflows/test.yml`
- ❌ Deleted `.github/workflows/performance-regression.yml`
- ✅ Kept `.github/workflows/claude-code-review.yml` (works correctly)

### Rationale:
1. **Broken tests provide false confidence** - worse than no tests
2. **CI noise blocks legitimate work** - every PR shows fake failures
3. **Infrastructure needs complete rebuild** - not just configuration fixes
4. **Honest assessment** - acknowledge current reality rather than pretend tests work

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Post-PERF-003):
1. Create TECH-DEBT-001 task for test infrastructure rebuild
2. Document test requirements and patterns
3. Evaluate testing frameworks (Jest vs Vitest)
4. Design proper test database strategy

### Medium Term:
1. Implement proper test database mocking/containerization
2. Fix dependency injection for testability
3. Create test utilities and shared fixtures
4. Re-implement tests one module at a time

### Long Term:
1. Re-add CI workflows once tests actually pass locally
2. Implement proper test coverage reporting
3. Add integration and E2E test infrastructure

## Test Modules That Need Fixing

### API Tests (15 failing suites):
- `src/services/form-engine/__tests__/form-engine.test.ts`
- `tests/startup/jwt-validation.test.ts`
- `tests/startup/http-server-startup.test.ts`
- `tests/routes/health.test.ts`
- `tests/routes/auth.routes.test.ts`
- `tests/integration/auth.integration.test.ts`
- `tests/db/migrations.test.ts`
- `tests/auth/rbac.middleware.test.ts`
- `tests/auth/permission.service.test.ts`
- `tests/auth/jwt.service.test.ts`
- `tests/auth/auth.service.test.ts`
- `tests/auth/auth.middleware.test.ts`
- And 3 others...

### Working Tests (7 passing suites):
- `src/services/form-engine/__tests__/errors.test.ts`
- `tests/config/jwt-config.test.ts`
- `tests/db/simple-connection.test.ts`
- `tests/db/schema.test.ts`
- `tests/db/connection.test.ts`
- `src/services/form-engine/__tests__/conditional-logic-engine.test.ts`
- 1 other...

## Lessons Learned

1. **Never add CI checks without ensuring they pass locally first**
2. **Test infrastructure must be designed before writing tests**
3. **Broken tests are worse than no tests** - they create false confidence
4. **Face reality rather than applying band-aid fixes**

## Related Tasks

- **TECH-DEBT-001**: Rebuild test infrastructure from scratch
- **IMPL-002**: Form Engine tests need complete rewrite
- **ERROR-001**: Error handling tests need proper mocking
- **AUTH-***: All auth tests need dependency injection fixes
