## Metadata
- **Status:** completed
- **Type:** feat
- **Epic:** phase-2-core-engines
- **Priority:** high
- **Size:** large
- **Created:** 2025-01-22
- **Updated:** 2025-01-22

## Completion Info
- **PR:** #4 (merged)
- **Branch:** feat/impl-002-form-engine-core (deleted)
- **Completed:** 2025-09-23
- **Merged By:** GitHub CLI

## Description
Implement the Form Engine component with form definition management, validation rules, conditional logic, and rendering metadata. This is the foundation for dynamic form creation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Form definition TypeScript interfaces (based on DOC-002-1 spec)
- [ ] Form CRUD operations implemented with Drizzle ORM
- [ ] Field type registry with 25+ supported types
- [ ] Validation engine with Zod integration and runtime validation
- [ ] Conditional logic evaluator with expression parser
- [ ] Form versioning system with automatic migration
- [ ] Form inheritance support with composition patterns
- [ ] REST API endpoints matching DOC-004-1 specification
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests with PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Performance tests for forms with 100+ fields
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Technical Notes
- Store definitions in JSONB columns using patterns from DOC-003-2
- Cache compiled validators in Redis (future) or memory
- Support custom field types through plugin registry
- Enable form composition and inheritance patterns
- Optimize for large forms (100+ fields) with lazy loading
- Implement real-time form updates via WebSocket
- Use Zod for runtime validation and TypeScript generation
- Follow security patterns from DOC-005 specification

## Branch Naming
**Suggested Branch:** `feat/impl-002-form-engine-core`

## Dependencies
- âœ… IMPL-001: Database setup (COMPLETED 2025-09-23)
- âœ… DOC-002-1: Form Engine specification (COMPLETED 2025-01-22)
- âœ… DOC-003-1: Core database schema (COMPLETED 2025-01-22)
- ðŸŽ¯ DOC-003-2: JSONB schema patterns (READY - can implement in parallel)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for validation logic
- Integration tests for CRUD
- Performance tests for large forms
- Edge cases for conditionals
