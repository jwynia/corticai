# PERF-004: Implement Adaptive Event Batching

## Metadata
- **Status:** ready
- **Type:** performance
- **Epic:** performance-optimization
- **Priority:** medium
- **Size:** medium
- **Created:** 2025-09-24

## Description
Enhance the Event Engine's batching strategy to adaptively adjust batch sizes and timing based on system load and event patterns. Current implementation uses fixed batch sizes and timeouts.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement dynamic batch size adjustment based on throughput
- [ ] Add priority queues for critical events
- [ ] Implement event compression for large batches
- [ ] Add backpressure handling
- [ ] Create performance metrics for batching efficiency
- [ ] Document optimal configuration settings

## Technical Notes
Current batching strategy:
- Fixed max batch size
- Fixed flush interval
- No prioritization
- No compression

Proposed improvements:
```typescript
interface AdaptiveBatchConfig {
  minBatchSize: number;
  maxBatchSize: number;
  targetLatency: number; // ms
  priorityLevels: number;
  compressionThreshold: number; // bytes
  backpressureThreshold: number;
}
```

## Implementation Ideas
1. **Adaptive Sizing**: Monitor event arrival rate and adjust batch size
2. **Priority Queues**: Separate queues for different priority levels
3. **Compression**: Use zlib for batches over threshold
4. **Backpressure**: Slow down producers when queue fills

## Dependencies
- IMPL-004: Event Engine Foundation (completed)
- PERF-003: Performance baselines (for comparison)

## Success Metrics
- Reduced p99 latency by 30%
- Improved throughput by 50%
- Memory usage remains stable
- No event loss under load

## Estimated Effort
- Research and design: 2-3 hours
- Implementation: 4-6 hours
- Testing: 2-3 hours
