# AUTH-002-4: Cleanup, Logging, and User Experience

## Metadata
- **Status:** ready
- **Type:** feature
- **Epic:** passwordless-authentication
- **Priority:** medium
- **Size:** small
- **Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days
- **Created:** 2025-10-01
- **Parent Task:** AUTH-002 (archived - oversized)
- **Branch:** feat/AUTH-002-4-cleanup-logging-user-experience

## Description
Implement token cleanup processes, comprehensive security logging, and polish the user-facing authentication flows. This includes automated cleanup of expired tokens, monitoring dashboards, and user-friendly error handling.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement scheduled cleanup process for expired tokens
- [ ] Add comprehensive security logging for all auth events
- [ ] Create user-friendly authentication flows with clear feedback
- [ ] Implement monitoring and alerting for authentication metrics
- [ ] Create documentation for magic link authentication

## Technical Notes
- Cleanup process should run daily via scheduled job
- Security logging must include relevant context without exposing sensitive data
- User flows should provide clear feedback at each step
- Monitoring should track key authentication metrics
- Documentation includes both user guide and technical reference

## Implementation Approach

### Token Cleanup Process
```typescript
// MagicLinkCleanupService
// - Cron job: daily at 2 AM
// - Delete tokens: expiresAt < 24 hours ago
// - Log deletion count
// - Record metric: magic_link.tokens_cleaned
```

### Security Logging
```typescript
// AuthLogger class
// Events: requested, sent, verified, expired, invalid, rate_limited
// Context: eventType, userId, emailHash, ipAddress, userAgent, success, error
// - Hash emails for privacy (SHA-256, first 16 chars)
// - Log info for success, warn for failures
// - Record metrics for each event type
```

### User Experience Flows
```typescript
// User-friendly responses
// Success: message, email, expiresIn, expirationMessage, nextSteps array
// Error: user-friendly messages via error map (RATE_LIMITED, INVALID_EMAIL, etc.)
// - Include support contact in error responses
// - Log all events (success and failure)
```

### Monitoring and Alerting
```typescript
// Metrics:
// - active_tokens (gauge): count of active, unexpired tokens
// - verification_time (histogram): time from request to verification
// - requests_total (counter): total requests
// - verifications_total (counter): labeled by success/failure

// Alerts:
// - High failure rate: >20% verification failures in 5m
// - Rate limiting spike: >10 rate limits in 5m
```

## Dependencies
- AUTH-002-3: Magic Link Verification and Rate Limiting

## Follows After
- AUTH-002-3: Magic Link Verification and Rate Limiting

## Enables
- Complete magic link authentication feature
- Production deployment readiness

## Testing Strategy
- Test cleanup process with various token states
- Verify logging captures all auth events
- Test user flows with different scenarios
- Verify metrics are recorded correctly
- Test alert triggers with simulated failures

## Success Metrics
- Cleanup process runs successfully daily
- All auth events are logged with appropriate context
- User feedback is clear and actionable
- Monitoring dashboards show key metrics
- Alerts trigger correctly for anomalies

## Documentation Requirements
- User guide for magic link authentication
- Technical reference for implementation
- Security considerations and best practices
- Monitoring and alerting setup guide
- Troubleshooting common issues
