# DOC-003-3: Document Existing Database Schema Architecture

## Metadata
- **Status:** completed
- **Type:** doc
- **Epic:** phase-1-foundation
- **Priority:** medium
- **Size:** small
- **Created:** 2025-09-25
- **Updated:** 2025-09-25
- **Parent:** DOC-003 (replaced due to implementation-first approach)

## Branch Info
- **Branch:** doc/database-schema-documentation
- **Worktree:** .worktrees/DOC-003-3
- **PR:** #10 (merged)
- **Completed:** 2025-09-25
- **Merged By:** jwynia

## Description
Document the existing comprehensive database schema implementation that has been built in `/apps/api/src/db/schema/`. The schemas are fully implemented with Drizzle ORM, but lack architectural documentation explaining design decisions, relationships, and usage patterns.

## Discovery Context
During grooming, discovered that DOC-003 original scope (create database schemas) is obsolete because:
- ✅ Complete schema implementation exists (252 lines across 7 files)
- ✅ All planned entities implemented: forms, users, events, submissions, workflows, organizations
- ✅ JSONB structures defined with proper indexes
- ✅ TypeScript types auto-generated
- ✅ Migration patterns established

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Create `docs/database-architecture.md` with schema overview
- [x] Document each schema file's purpose and relationships
- [x] Explain JSONB usage patterns and validation strategies
- [x] Document indexing strategy and performance considerations
- [x] Include entity relationship diagram
- [x] Document migration patterns and best practices
- [x] Add code examples for common query patterns
- [x] Document schema evolution and versioning approach

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Schema Files to Document
```
/apps/api/src/db/schema/
├── index.ts (35 lines) - Type exports and main index
├── organizations.ts (11 lines) - Tenant isolation
├── users.ts (44 lines) - Auth/profile with JSONB preferences
├── forms.ts (35 lines) - Form definitions with JSONB schema
├── submissions.ts (45 lines) - Form data with JSONB storage
├── workflows.ts (39 lines) - Business logic with trigger enums
└── events.ts (46 lines) - Event sourcing with correlation IDs
```

### Documentation Structure
```markdown
# Database Architecture

## Overview
- Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL 15+
- JSONB for flexible schemas
- Event sourcing patterns
- Multi-tenant architecture

## Schema Details
### Organizations (Tenancy)
### Users (Authentication & Profiles)
### Forms (Dynamic Form Definitions)
### Submissions (Form Data Storage)
### Workflows (Business Logic)
### Events (Event Sourcing)

## Indexing Strategy
## JSONB Patterns
## Migration Approach
## Query Examples
```

## Dependencies
- **None** - All schemas implemented and working
- Access to existing schema files for documentation

## Testing Strategy
- Validate documentation against actual schema implementation
- Include runnable query examples
- Cross-reference with existing tests

## Success Metrics
- Complete coverage of all 7 schema files
- Clear explanation of design decisions
- Usable examples for new developers
- Architecture alignment documentation

## Estimated Effort
- Schema analysis and documentation: 3-4 hours
- Diagram creation: 1-2 hours
- Example queries and patterns: 2-3 hours
- Review and refinement: 1 hour
- **Total: 7-10 hours**

## Why This Matters
- Onboarding: New developers need architecture understanding
- Maintenance: Schema evolution requires documented decisions
- Integration: Other services need schema understanding
- Compliance: Data models require documentation for audits

## Implementation Approach
1. **Analyze Implementation**: Review all schema files to understand current state
2. **Extract Patterns**: Identify common patterns and design decisions
3. **Document Architecture**: Create comprehensive architecture documentation
4. **Add Examples**: Include practical usage examples
5. **Create Diagrams**: Visual representation of relationships
6. **Validate**: Ensure accuracy against implementation

## Related Work
- Original DOC-003 identified the need for schema documentation
- Implementation team chose code-first approach (Drizzle schemas)
