## Description
Performance requirements are scattered throughout Phase 2 tasks but lack a centralized specification document.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Define response time requirements for all operations
- [x] Specify throughput requirements
- [x] Document scalability targets
- [x] Define resource utilization limits
- [x] Specify database query performance targets
- [x] Document caching strategies
- [x] Include:
  - [x] Latency budgets per component
  - [x] Concurrent user targets
  - [x] Data volume projections
  - [x] Query optimization guidelines
  - [x] Performance monitoring requirements
  - [x] Performance testing scenarios

## Technical Notes
- Define SLAs for each component
- Include performance anti-patterns
- Specify optimization priorities
- Document profiling strategies

## Dependencies
- Component specifications
- Architecture documentation

## Testing Strategy
- Performance benchmark validation
- Load testing scenarios
- Stress testing plans

## Completion Notes
**Completed:** 2025-09-23

Created comprehensive performance requirements documentation at `/context-network/foundation/performance/requirements.md` including:
- Response time targets (p50, p95, p99) for all operation types
- Throughput requirements for transactions, events, and API requests
- Scalability targets with auto-scaling configurations
- Component-specific performance requirements
- Multi-layer caching strategy
- Database optimization guidelines
- Monitoring and alerting thresholds
- Load testing scenarios (baseline, stress, spike)
- Performance budget definitions
- CQRS read model optimizations (10x-1000x gains)

All acceptance criteria fulfilled with detailed metrics and implementation guidance.
