# SEC-011: Implement Secure Authentication State Storage

## Metadata
- **Status:** ready
- **Type:** security
- **Epic:** web-auth
- **Priority:** high
- **Size:** medium
- **Estimated Effort:** 3-5 days
- **Created:** 2025-10-01
- **Created From:** PR #26 code review feedback
- **Related Tasks:** WEB-007-1

## Description
Replace localStorage-based authentication state storage with a more secure solution to mitigate XSS attack vulnerabilities. Currently, auth state (including user information) is stored in plain text in localStorage, which is accessible to any JavaScript code running on the page.

## Problem Statement
From PR #26 code review:
> **localStorage Security** - Storing auth state in localStorage is accessible to XSS attacks. Consider using sessionStorage for more sensitive data or implementing encryption.

Current implementation in `auth-provider.tsx`:
```typescript
// INSECURE: Plain text storage
localStorage.setItem('auth_state', JSON.stringify({
  isAuthenticated: true,
  user: parsed.user
}));
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Evaluate and choose secure storage approach (httpOnly cookies vs encrypted storage)
- [ ] Implement chosen secure storage mechanism
- [ ] Migrate existing localStorage persistence to new approach
- [ ] Add encryption/decryption if using client-side storage
- [ ] Update tests to cover new security measures
- [ ] Document security considerations in code comments

## Technical Options

### Option A: httpOnly Cookies (Recommended)
**Pros:**
- Not accessible to JavaScript (XSS protection)
- Automatic CSRF protection with SameSite attribute
- Server-side session management
- Industry standard for auth tokens

**Cons:**
- Requires backend API changes
- More complex implementation
- Need CORS configuration

### Option B: Encrypted localStorage
**Pros:**
- Minimal API changes
- Works offline
- Easier migration path

**Cons:**
- Still vulnerable if encryption key is compromised
- Key management complexity
- Not as secure as httpOnly cookies

### Option C: sessionStorage + encryption
**Pros:**
- Cleared on tab close (less persistent)
- Can be encrypted
- No server changes needed

**Cons:**
- Lost on page refresh (poor UX)
- Still client-side storage

## Recommended Approach
**Phase 1: httpOnly Cookie Implementation**
1. Update backend API to set httpOnly cookies for auth tokens
2. Store session ID in httpOnly cookie
3. Move user state to server-side session or validate via API calls
4. Remove localStorage auth persistence

**Phase 2: Client State Management**
1. Keep non-sensitive UI state in memory only
2. Fetch user data from API on page load using session cookie
3. Implement proper session timeout handling

## Implementation Notes
- Coordinate with AUTH-001 (Authentication Infrastructure Foundation)
- May need to update WEB-007-2 through WEB-007-8 auth flow implementations
- Consider using `js-cookie` library for cookie management
- Implement proper CSRF protection (SameSite, CSRF tokens)

## Testing Strategy
- Security testing for XSS attack scenarios
- Session persistence across page reloads
- Cookie expiration handling
- CSRF protection verification
- Cross-browser cookie support testing

## Dependencies
- AUTH-001: Authentication Infrastructure Foundation (backend support)
- WEB-007-1: Current localStorage implementation

## Blocks
- May affect WEB-007-2 through WEB-007-8 if implemented mid-development

## Success Metrics
- Auth state not accessible via `localStorage.getItem()`
- XSS attacks cannot steal auth credentials
- Session persists appropriately across page reloads
- Zero security vulnerabilities in auth state management

## Security Checklist
- [ ] httpOnly flag set on auth cookies
- [ ] Secure flag set (HTTPS only)
- [ ] SameSite attribute configured
- [ ] Proper expiration times set
- [ ] CSRF protection implemented
- [ ] Session invalidation on logout
- [ ] Security audit passed
