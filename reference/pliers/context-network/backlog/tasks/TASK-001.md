## Description
Install and configure GitHub CLI for PR management workflow. This enables the automated PR creation and merging capabilities required by the /pr-prep and /pr-complete commands.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] GitHub CLI installed and accessible via `gh` command
- [x] Authentication completed with `gh auth login`
- [x] Verify access with `gh auth status`
- [x] Test PR list access with `gh pr list`
- [x] Document installation method used

## Technical Notes
- Use official GitHub CLI installation instructions
- Prefer package manager installation (brew, apt, etc.)
- Use HTTPS protocol for authentication
- Set up with appropriate scopes for PR management

## Dependencies
- None - this is a prerequisite task

## Testing Strategy
- Verify `gh --version` returns version info
- Confirm `gh auth status` shows authenticated
- Test `gh pr list` returns results (or empty list)
- Verify `gh repo view` works for current repo

## Notes
- Required before any PR workflow commands can be used
- One-time setup per development environment
- Token can be reused across multiple repositories
- **Completed:** GitHub CLI already configured and working
