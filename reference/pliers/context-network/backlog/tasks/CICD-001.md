# CICD-001: Fix Critical CI/CD Pipeline Blocking Issues

## Metadata
- **Status:** completed
- **Type:** bugfix
- **Epic:** infrastructure
- **Priority:** critical
- **Size:** large
- **Created:** 2025-09-26
- **Completed:** 2025-09-26
- **PR:** #16 (merged)
- **Merged By:** jwynia

## Description
Multiple critical issues are blocking the CI/CD pipeline from functioning properly, preventing deployments and quality checks from running successfully.

## Current Issues Blocking CI/CD

### 1. GitHub Actions Deprecation (Pipeline Failing)
- `actions/download-artifact: v3` is deprecated - breaks Performance Regression Detection
- `actions/upload-artifact: v3` is deprecated - breaks artifact uploads
- **Impact:** Complete pipeline failures

### 2. TypeScript Build Failures (Code Quality)
- Unused variables: `rbacMiddleware`, `requestHeaders`, `requestMethod`, `windowStart`
- Missing return statements: "Not all code paths return a value" in multiple functions
- Type errors: `'error' is of type 'unknown'` in error handling
- **Impact:** Build process fails, preventing deployments

### 3. Linting Issues (Code Quality)
- `@pliers/shared#lint` fails with exit code 2
- **Impact:** Code quality checks fail

### 4. Test Infrastructure Problems (Testing)
- `@pliers/ai-service#test` fails with exit code 1
- Integration test database setup fails
- Missing test result artifacts
- **Impact:** Cannot validate code changes

## Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix (Critical Path)
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions to v4 versions:
  - [ ] Replace `actions/download-artifact@v3` with `@v4`
  - [ ] Replace `actions/upload-artifact@v3` with `@v4`
  - [ ] Test artifact upload/download functionality
- [ ] Fix TypeScript build errors:
  - [ ] Remove unused variables or mark as used
  - [ ] Add proper return statements to all code paths
  - [ ] Fix type assertions for error handling
  - [ ] Ensure build passes with strict TypeScript checks
- [ ] Resolve linting failures:
  - [ ] Fix all linting errors in `@pliers/shared` package
  - [ ] Ensure consistent code style across packages
- [ ] Fix test infrastructure:
  - [ ] Resolve `@pliers/ai-service` test failures
  - [ ] Fix integration test database setup
  - [ ] Ensure test artifacts are properly generated

### Should Fix (Quality Improvements)
- [ ] Add proper error handling patterns
- [ ] Improve test coverage reporting
- [ ] Add better error messages for CI failures
- [ ] Document CI/CD troubleshooting

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: GitHub Actions Updates (Low Risk)
1. Update `.github/workflows/` files to use v4 actions
2. Test artifact functionality with simple workflow
3. Verify no breaking changes in artifact structure

### Phase 2: TypeScript Fixes (Medium Risk)
1. Audit and fix unused variables
2. Add return statements or proper error handling
3. Improve type safety for error objects
4. Run incremental builds to verify fixes

### Phase 3: Linting Resolution (Low Risk)
1. Run linting locally to identify specific issues
2. Fix formatting and style violations
3. Update linting configuration if needed
4. Ensure consistent rules across packages

### Phase 4: Test Infrastructure (High Risk)
1. Investigate ai-service test failures
2. Fix database connection and setup issues
3. Ensure proper test artifact generation
4. Add test environment validation

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] All GitHub Actions workflows complete successfully
- [ ] Build process completes without errors
- [ ] All linting checks pass
- [ ] Unit tests pass in all packages
- [ ] Integration tests can connect to database
- [ ] Test artifacts are properly uploaded
- [ ] Performance regression detection works

## Dependencies
- Access to repository GitHub Actions settings
- Local development environment with all packages
- Test database configuration
- Understanding of current linting rules

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** Test infrastructure changes could break existing tests
- **Medium Risk:** TypeScript changes might introduce regressions
- **Low Risk:** GitHub Actions updates are mostly configuration changes

## Files Likely to Change
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Update action versions
- `.github/workflows/performance.yml` - Update action versions
- `apps/api/src/auth/auth.middleware.ts` - Fix TypeScript errors
- `apps/api/src/app.ts` - Remove unused variables
- `packages/shared/` - Fix linting issues
- `apps/ai-service/` - Fix test failures
- Various TypeScript files with build errors

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All CI/CD workflows show green status
- [ ] Build time improvements (no error retries)
- [ ] Test execution reliability increases
- [ ] Zero deployment blocking issues
- [ ] Artifact upload/download functionality restored
