## Description
Error handling and logging patterns are not documented, which could lead to inconsistent implementation across components.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Define error classification system
- [x] Document error response formats
- [x] Specify logging levels and when to use them
- [x] Define structured logging format
- [x] Document error recovery patterns
- [x] Specify monitoring and alerting requirements
- [x] Include:
  - [x] Custom error classes
  - [x] Error code conventions
  - [x] User-facing error messages
  - [x] Debug information requirements
  - [x] Log aggregation strategy
  - [x] Distributed tracing setup

## Technical Notes
- Use structured JSON logging
- Define correlation ID patterns
- Include error boundary strategies
- Specify retry and circuit breaker patterns

## Dependencies
- Component specifications
- API documentation

## Testing Strategy
- Error scenario testing
- Log format validation
- Alert testing

## Completion Notes
**Completed:** 2025-09-23

Created comprehensive error handling and logging standards at `/context-network/foundation/error-handling/standards.md` including:
- Error severity levels and categories
- StandardError object structure with all required fields
- Hierarchical error code system (E1xxx-E5xxx)
- Retry strategies with exponential backoff
- Circuit breaker pattern implementation
- Saga error compensation handling
- Structured logging format with correlation IDs
- Log levels with usage guidelines
- Fallback mechanisms and graceful degradation
- Client-side error boundaries
- Performance diagnostics and debugging tools
- Error catalog with documentation
- Alert configuration thresholds

All acceptance criteria fulfilled with production-ready patterns and examples.
