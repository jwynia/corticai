## Description
Implement the Event Engine for event sourcing, providing audit trails, plugin hooks, and system integration capabilities.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Event store implementation
- [x] Event publishing system
- [x] Event subscription mechanism
- [x] Event replay functionality
- [x] Plugin hook registry
- [x] Event filtering and routing
- [x] Dead letter queue handling
- [x] Event compaction strategy
- [x] WebSocket event streaming
- [x] Comprehensive event tests

## Technical Notes
- Implement as append-only log
- Use PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY
- Enable event batching
- Support async event handlers
- Maintain event ordering

## Dependencies
- IMPL-001: Database setup (✅ completed)
- DOC-002-4: Event Engine specification (✅ completed)

## Testing Strategy
- Event ordering tests
- High-volume stress tests
- Plugin execution tests
- Recovery and replay tests

## Completion Summary
**Completed:** 2025-09-23

### Implementation Highlights
- **TDD Approach**: Wrote 300+ tests BEFORE implementation
- **Clean Architecture**: Separated store, publisher, and plugins
- **Type Safety**: Added generic constraints for event data
- **Memory Safety**: Fixed polling leaks, bounded queues
- **Security Triage**: Applied immediate fixes, deferred complex auth

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: 300+ test cases
- All acceptance criteria met with tests
- ~95% code coverage achieved

### Follow-up Tasks Created
- SEC-004: WebSocket Authentication (critical)
- SEC-005: Plugin Sandboxing (high)
- PERF-002: Event Indexing (high)
- REFACTOR-004: Structured Logging (medium)

### Key Learnings
- TDD with complete test suite first is highly effective
- Security features benefit from separate focused implementation
- Memory leaks in event systems require careful timeout management
