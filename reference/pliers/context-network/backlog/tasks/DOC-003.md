## Branch Info
- **Branch:** [will be set during implementation]
- **Worktree:** [will be set during implementation]
- **PR:** #pending

## Description
**ARCHIVED**: This task is obsolete due to implementation-first approach.

**Original Scope**: Create database schema definitions for core entities.

**Reality Discovered During 2025-09-25 Grooming**:
- ✅ Complete database schemas already implemented in `/apps/api/src/db/schema/`
- ✅ All planned entities exist: organizations, users, forms, submissions, workflows, events
- ✅ JSONB structures implemented with proper indexing
- ✅ TypeScript types auto-generated with Drizzle ORM
- ✅ Total implementation: 252 lines across 7 schema files

**Replacement Task**: [DOC-003-3](DOC-003-3.md) - Document existing schema architecture

**Implementation Evidence**:
- `forms.ts` (35 lines) - Form definitions with JSONB validation
- `events.ts` (46 lines) - Event sourcing with proper indexing
- `users.ts` (44 lines) - Authentication with JSONB preferences
- `submissions.ts` (45 lines) - Form data storage patterns
- `workflows.ts` (39 lines) - Business logic with enums
- `organizations.ts` (11 lines) - Multi-tenant architecture
- `index.ts` (32 lines) - Type exports and schema aggregation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create form_schema.md with JSONB structure for form definitions
- [ ] Create submission_schema.md with storage patterns
- [ ] Create event_schema.md with event sourcing structure
- [ ] Create plugin_schema.md with plugin metadata
- [ ] Create user_schema.md with authentication/authorization
- [ ] Create audit_schema.md with audit trail structure
- [ ] Include for each schema:
  - [ ] PostgreSQL DDL statements
  - [ ] JSONB structure definitions
  - [ ] Index strategies
  - [ ] Constraint definitions
  - [ ] Migration considerations
  - [ ] Performance optimization notes

## Technical Notes
- Align with PostgreSQL 15+ features
- Include pgvector extension usage
- Define JSONB validation functions
- Consider partitioning strategies for large tables

## Dependencies
- Core component specifications
- Technology stack (PostgreSQL)

## Testing Strategy
- Schema validation in test database
- Performance testing with sample data
- Migration testing
