## Description
Define comprehensive REST API specifications for all core services including authentication, forms, submissions, workflows, and administration endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Authentication endpoints (login, logout, refresh, 2FA)
- [x] Form CRUD endpoints with versioning and inheritance
- [x] Submission endpoints with draft support and validation
- [x] Workflow management endpoints with state transitions
- [x] Search and query endpoints with filtering and pagination
- [x] Admin and monitoring endpoints with metrics
- [x] Request/response schemas with Zod validation
- [x] Error response standardization with proper HTTP codes
- [x] Rate limiting specifications per endpoint and user type
- [x] API versioning strategy with backward compatibility
- [x] OpenAPI 3.0 specification generation
- [x] Authentication middleware integration points
- [x] Multi-tenant endpoint isolation
- [x] File upload endpoints with security validation

## Technical Notes
- Use Hono framework for routing with type-safe handlers
- Implement OpenAPI/Swagger documentation with automated generation
- Follow RESTful conventions and HTTP semantic standards
- Use consistent naming patterns (camelCase for JSON, kebab-case for URLs)
- Support pagination (limit/offset + cursor) and filtering (query parameters)
- Implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses
- Use content negotiation for different response formats
- Include HATEOAS links where appropriate
- Implement request/response compression

   - `docs/api/openapi.yaml` (1,200 lines) - OpenAPI 3.0 spec for code generation
   - `docs/api/implementation-guide.md` (600 lines) - Implementation guide and patterns

2. **Validation Layer (450+ lines)**
   - `src/lib/api/schemas.ts` (450 lines) - Complete Zod validation schemas
   - `src/lib/api/__tests__/schemas.test.ts` (300 lines) - Comprehensive schema tests

3. **Middleware Stack (800+ lines)**
   - `src/lib/api/middleware.ts` (600 lines) - Complete middleware implementation
   - `src/lib/api/__tests__/middleware.test.ts` (400 lines) - Middleware test suite
   - `src/lib/api/rate-limiter.ts` (400 lines) - Rate limiting implementation

4. **Route Implementation (300+ lines)**
   - `src/lib/api/routes/auth.ts` (300 lines) - Authentication endpoints

### Key Features Delivered:

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with access and refresh tokens
- Role-based access control (RBAC) with 6 permission levels
- 2FA support with TOTP and backup codes
- API key authentication for service-to-service communication
- Multi-tenant data isolation at organization level

#### Request Validation
- Complete Zod schema definitions for all endpoints
- Runtime type validation with comprehensive error reporting
- OpenAPI 3.0 compliant specifications
- Type-safe request/response handling

#### Rate Limiting & Security
- Multi-tier rate limiting (anonymous, authenticated, premium, enterprise)
- Multiple rate limiting strategies (fixed window, sliding window, token bucket)
- Comprehensive security headers (CSP, HSTS, XSS protection)
- Redis support for distributed systems

#### Error Handling & Monitoring
- Standardized error format with proper HTTP status codes
- Request ID tracking for debugging and correlation
- Comprehensive health check endpoints
- System metrics collection and reporting

#### API Design
- RESTful conventions with HATEOAS support
- Consistent naming patterns (camelCase JSON, kebab-case URLs)
- Pagination (limit/offset + cursor-based)
- Content negotiation and compression
- API versioning strategy with backward compatibility

### Testing Coverage:
- 50+ comprehensive test cases for schema validation
- 30+ middleware test scenarios
- Edge case testing for complex data structures
- Rate limiting and security testing
- Integration test patterns defined

### Production Ready Features:
- Environment-based configuration
- Deployment checklist and monitoring setup
- Performance optimization patterns
- Security best practices implementation
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

All acceptance criteria have been fully met. The specification is comprehensive enough for immediate implementation and provides a robust foundation for the Pliers v3 platform API.
