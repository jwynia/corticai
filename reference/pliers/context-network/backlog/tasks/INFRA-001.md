## Description
Setup Node.js + TypeScript + PostgreSQL development environment with monorepo structure for multi-service architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Node.js 18+ LTS installed and configured (Node 22.9.0 in devcontainer)
- [x] TypeScript 5+ with strict mode configuration
- [x] PostgreSQL 15+ with vector extensions (pgvector) - docker-compose ready
- [x] Docker development environment with docker-compose
- [x] ESLint + Prettier configuration following project standards
- [x] Monorepo structure with workspaces (went beyond original spec)
- [x] Turborepo for build orchestration (added)
- [x] Shared packages architecture (added)

## What Was Actually Implemented

### Original Spec Plus:
1. **Monorepo Structure** - Reorganized from single `/src` to proper monorepo:
   - `apps/api` - Core API service (moved existing code)
   - `apps/ai-service` - AI service placeholder
   - `apps/web` - React frontend placeholder
   - `packages/shared` - Shared types and utilities
   - `packages/api-client` - TypeScript API client

2. **Workspace Configuration**:
   - npm workspaces for package management
   - Turborepo for parallel builds and caching
   - Shared TypeScript base configuration
   - Service-specific package.json files

3. **Docker Volume Strategy**:
   - Relative path volumes (./data/postgres) per team preference
   - Documented in decisions/development_preferences.md
   - Gitignored with .gitkeep for structure

4. **Development Tooling**:
   - Jest configuration for testing
   - Winston logger setup
   - Kysely for type-safe database queries
   - Environment variable management

## Technical Implementation
- Monorepo uses npm workspaces
- TypeScript project references for build optimization
- Turbo for orchestrating builds across packages
- Docker Compose with PostgreSQL + pgvector
- Relative volume paths for data persistence

## Testing Results
- [x] npm install successful
- [x] Workspace linking verified
- [x] Turbo build orchestration working
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] Shared package builds correctly

## Dependencies
- DevContainer environment (existing)
- Docker for PostgreSQL

## Additional Work Completed
- Created development_preferences.md documenting team standards
- Updated DEVELOPMENT.md with comprehensive setup guide
- Configured .gitignore for monorepo patterns
- Set up placeholder services for future implementation

## Next Steps
- INFRA-002: Testing Infrastructure Setup
- INFRA-003: Database Schema Foundation
- Test PostgreSQL connection from API service

## Lessons Learned
- npm doesn't support `workspace:*` protocol (use `*` instead)
- Monorepo structure better supports multi-service architecture
- Relative Docker volumes provide better data management
