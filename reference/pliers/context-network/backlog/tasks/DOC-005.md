## Branch Info
- **Branch:** feat/doc-005-security-architecture
- **Worktree:** [will be set during implementation]
- **PR:** #pending

## Description
Security architecture is mentioned in the roadmap but lacks detailed documentation. This is critical for Phase 2 implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Document authentication architecture (JWT, refresh tokens)
- [x] Define authorization model (RBAC, permissions)
- [x] Specify data encryption requirements
- [x] Document API security measures
- [x] Define plugin security sandbox
- [x] Specify audit and compliance requirements
- [x] Document threat model and mitigations
- [x] Include:
  - [x] Security patterns and best practices
  - [x] Key management strategy
  - [x] Session management
  - [x] Input validation requirements
  - [x] SQL injection prevention
  - [x] XSS prevention strategies

## Technical Notes
- Align with OWASP best practices
- Consider SOC2 compliance requirements
- Define security headers configuration
- Document rate limiting strategies

### Multi-Tenant Security Enhancement (2025-09-23)

#### PostgreSQL Row-Level Security Implementation
Based on latest research, implement **comprehensive RLS** for multi-tenancy:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on all tenant-scoped tables
ALTER TABLE forms ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE submissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create tenant isolation policies
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON forms
    USING (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::UUID)
    WITH CHECK (tenant_id = current_setting('app.current_tenant')::UUID);

-- Set tenant context per request
SET LOCAL app.current_tenant = '${tenantId}';
```

#### Implementation Strategy
1. **Connection-Level**: Set tenant context on connection acquisition
2. **Request-Level**: Validate tenant context on each API request
3. **Database-Level**: RLS automatically enforces isolation
4. **Audit-Level**: Include tenant_id in all audit logs

#### Key Security Benefits
- **Bulletproof Isolation**: Database enforces tenant boundaries
- **Performance**: Indexed tenant_id columns for fast filtering
- **Simplicity**: No application-level filtering needed
- **Compliance**: Meets data isolation requirements
- **Auditability**: Clear tenant access patterns

#### Testing Requirements
- Automated tests for cross-tenant access attempts
- Performance benchmarks with multiple tenants
- Penetration testing for isolation bypass

See [RLS Research](../../discoveries/records/2025-09-23-technical-research.md#multi-tenant-row-level-security-patterns) for complete patterns.

## Dependencies
- None (Technology stack is defined in context network)

## Testing Strategy
- Security review checklist
- Penetration testing plan
- Compliance validation

## Implementation Summary
Task completed successfully with comprehensive security architecture documentation created at `/workspaces/pliers/context-network/foundation/security/`:

### Deliverables Created:
1. **architecture.md** - Main security architecture document covering defense-in-depth model, security components, implementation patterns, and monitoring frameworks
2. **authentication.md** - Detailed authentication and session management specifications including JWT implementation, MFA, password security, and audit logging
3. **authorization.md** - Comprehensive RBAC and permissions model with policy-based access control, resource-level security, and database row-level security
4. **threats.md** - Complete threat model using STRIDE methodology, OWASP Top 10 mitigations, and advanced persistent threat considerations
5. **compliance.md** - SOC2 Type II, GDPR, and multi-framework compliance requirements with automated monitoring and data classification

### Key Features Documented:
- JWT-based authentication with RS256 signing and refresh token rotation
- Hierarchical RBAC with role inheritance and fine-grained permissions
- Policy-based authorization with context-aware decisions
- Field-level security with data masking and encryption
- Comprehensive threat model addressing all STRIDE categories
- OWASP Top 10 specific mitigations and security patterns
- SOC2 and GDPR compliance frameworks with automated validation
- Audit trail implementation with integrity protection
- Data classification framework with automated handling
- Security monitoring and incident response procedures

All acceptance criteria have been fulfilled with implementation-ready specifications aligned with OWASP best practices and SOC2 compliance requirements.
