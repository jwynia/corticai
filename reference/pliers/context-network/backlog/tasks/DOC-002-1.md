- **PR:** #pending

## Description
Create comprehensive specification for the Form Engine component, including form definitions, field types, validation rules, conditional logic, and rendering instructions. This specification must be detailed enough for LLM agents to implement the component independently.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Form definition schema documented with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] All supported field types specified (text, number, date, select, etc.)
- [x] Validation rule system defined with examples
- [x] Conditional logic engine specified
- [x] Form versioning strategy documented
- [x] Form inheritance and composition patterns defined
- [x] Rendering hints and UI metadata specified
- [x] JSONB storage schema designed
- [x] API endpoints for form CRUD operations defined
- [x] Integration points with other engines documented

## Technical Notes
- Use Zod schemas for runtime validation
- Store form definitions in PostgreSQL JSONB columns
- Support both JSON Schema and custom validation rules
- Enable form composition and reusability
- Consider performance for forms with 100+ fields

## Dependencies
- DOC-001: Foundation structure (completed)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for form validation logic
- Integration tests for form storage/retrieval
- Performance tests for large forms
- Edge cases for conditional logic

## Completion Summary

Task completed successfully. Created comprehensive Form Engine specification including:
