## Description
While connections/interfaces.md exists, we need detailed API specifications for all service boundaries and integration points.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Define GraphQL schema for external API
- [x] Specify REST endpoints for admin operations
- [x] Document WebSocket protocols for real-time updates
- [x] Define internal service interfaces
- [x] Specify plugin API contracts
- [x] Document event bus protocols
- [x] Include for each API:
  - [x] OpenAPI/GraphQL schema definitions
  - [x] Authentication/authorization requirements
  - [x] Rate limiting specifications
  - [x] Error response formats
  - [x] Versioning strategy
  - [x] Example requests/responses

## Technical Notes
- Use OpenAPI 3.1 for REST APIs
- Use GraphQL SDL for GraphQL schemas
- Define TypeScript interfaces for all contracts
- Include WebSocket event specifications

## Dependencies
- Core component specifications
- Service architecture decisions

## Testing Strategy
- API mock server setup
- Contract testing specifications
- Integration test scenarios

## Completion Notes
**Completed:** 2025-09-23

Created comprehensive API documentation:

1. **Central Overview** at `/context-network/foundation/api/overview.md`:
   - API gateway pattern and versioning strategy
   - REST API standards with pagination and filtering
   - GraphQL schema with queries, mutations, subscriptions
   - WebSocket protocol and message format
   - Authentication (JWT) and API key management
   - Rate limiting configuration
   - Inter-service communication patterns
   - OpenAPI specification examples

2. **Component-Specific APIs** (already existing):
   - Form Engine API (`/foundation/components/form-engine/api.md`)
   - Submission Engine API (`/foundation/components/submission-engine/api.md`)
   - Event Engine API (`/foundation/components/event-engine/api.md`)
   - Plugin Engine API (`/foundation/components/plugin-engine/api.md`)
   - Workflow Engine API (`/foundation/components/workflow-engine/api.md`)
   - Search Engine API (`/foundation/components/search-engine/api.md`)
   - AI Engine API (`/foundation/components/ai-engine/api.md`)

All acceptance criteria fulfilled with production-ready API specifications.
