- **Superseded:** 2025-10-01
- **Superseded By:** WEB-007 series (WEB-007-1 through WEB-007-8)

## Superseded By WEB-007 Series

This task has been superseded by the WEB-007 series, which provides more comprehensive and better-structured coverage of the frontend authentication UX:

- **WEB-007-1** (Authentication Context and Device Detection) - Covers device capability detection and auth method recommendation
- **WEB-007-2** (Authentication Method Selector) - Covers authentication method selection interface
- **WEB-007-3** (Passkey Flow) - Covers passkey authentication implementation
- **WEB-007-4** (Magic Link Flow) - Covers magic link authentication implementation
- **WEB-007-5** (Password Flow) - Covers password authentication implementation
- **WEB-007-6** (Account Management) - Covers user profile and preference management
- **WEB-007-7** (Security Settings) - Covers authentication method management and user preferences
- **WEB-007-8** (MFA UI) - Covers multi-factor authentication interface

The WEB-007 series provides more granular task decomposition and better separation of concerns, making implementation more manageable while covering all the requirements originally specified in AUTH-005.

## Original Description
Create an intelligent user experience that recommends the best authentication method based on device capabilities, user preferences, and context. This provides seamless integration of passkeys, magic links, and traditional passwords.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement device capability detection for optimal auth method recommendation
- [ ] Create authentication method selection interface
- [ ] Add user preference persistence for authentication methods
- [ ] Implement progressive disclosure of authentication options
- [ ] Create user onboarding flows for each authentication method
- [ ] Add authentication method switching capability
- [ ] Implement fallback chains (passkey → magic link → password)
- [ ] Create clear user guidance and educational content
- [ ] Add accessibility support for all authentication flows
- [ ] Optimize for mobile and desktop user experiences

## Technical Notes
- Build on existing form-driven UI patterns established in the platform
- Use capability detection API from AUTH-001
- Store user preferences in existing user profile system
- Follow platform design system and accessibility guidelines

## Dependencies
- AUTH-001: Authentication Infrastructure Foundation
- AUTH-002: Magic Link Authentication Implementation
- AUTH-004: Passkey (WebAuthn) Authentication Implementation

## Security Impact
- **Current Risk:** LOW - UX improvements don't affect security
- **Post-Implementation Risk:** LOW - Better UX may improve security adoption
- **Benefits:** Users more likely to adopt secure methods with good UX

## Authentication Method Recommendation Logic
```typescript
interface AuthRecommendation {
  primary: 'passkey' | 'magic-link' | 'password';
  alternatives: AuthMethod[];
  reasoning: string;
}

function recommendAuthMethod(context: AuthContext): AuthRecommendation {
  // Device supports biometrics + user hasn't declined passkeys
  if (context.supportsBiometrics && !context.userDeclinedPasskeys) {
    return {
      primary: 'passkey',
      alternatives: ['magic-link', 'password'],
      reasoning: 'Most secure option available on this device'
    };
  }

  // Mobile device + email accessible
  if (context.isMobile && context.emailAccessible) {
    return {
      primary: 'magic-link',
      alternatives: ['passkey', 'password'],
      reasoning: 'Quick and secure on mobile devices'
    };
  }

  // Shared/public device
  if (context.isSharedDevice) {
    return {
      primary: 'magic-link',
      alternatives: ['password'],
      reasoning: 'Safe option for shared devices'
    };
  }

  // Default: offer all options
  return {
    primary: 'password',
    alternatives: ['passkey', 'magic-link'],
    reasoning: 'Traditional method with modern alternatives'
  };
}
```

## User Interface Components
- **Auth Method Selector:** Visual picker for authentication methods
- **Capability Indicator:** Shows what methods are available on current device
- **Progress Indicator:** Clear steps during authentication flows
- **Educational Tooltips:** Explains benefits of each method
- **Preference Settings:** User can set default authentication method
- **Fallback Messaging:** Clear guidance when primary method fails

## Onboarding Flows
1. **New User Registration:**
   - Detect device capabilities
   - Recommend best method for their device
   - Optional: Set up multiple methods for redundancy

2. **Existing User Migration:**
   - Explain new passwordless options
   - Gradual migration from passwords
   - Maintain access during transition

3. **Method Addition:**
   - Add passkey to existing magic link user
   - Add magic link as backup to passkey user

## User Preference Management
```typescript
interface UserAuthPreferences {
  preferredMethod: 'passkey' | 'magic-link' | 'password';
  enabledMethods: AuthMethod[];
  showRecommendations: boolean;
  rememberDevice: boolean;
  fallbackChain: AuthMethod[];
}
```

## Accessibility Requirements
- Screen reader compatible authentication flows
- Keyboard navigation for all interfaces
- High contrast support for visual elements
- Clear focus indicators
- Alternative text for all visual cues
- Voice control compatibility

## Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly authentication buttons
- Biometric integration (Face ID, Touch ID, fingerprint)
- App switching for email verification
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Offline capability detection

## Testing Strategy
- Usability testing with different user types
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Cross-device testing (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- A/B testing for recommendation algorithms
- Performance testing for method switching speed
- User preference persistence testing

## Success Metrics
- Authentication method adoption rates
- User onboarding completion rates
- Authentication success rates by method
- User satisfaction scores
- Support ticket reduction
- Time-to-authentication by method

## Educational Content
- **Passkey Benefits:** "More secure than passwords, works with your face, fingerprint, or device PIN"
- **Magic Link Benefits:** "No passwords to remember, secure link sent to your email"
- **Security Explanations:** Clear, non-technical language about security benefits
- **Troubleshooting Guides:** Help for common issues with each method
