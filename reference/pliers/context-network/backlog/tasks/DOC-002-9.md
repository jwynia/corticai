## Description
Create comprehensive specification for the Event Engine component, building on the foundation already implemented in IMPL-004 to provide complete documentation for Phase 2 development.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Document existing EventEngine interfaces and patterns
- [x] Specify event sourcing patterns and best practices
- [x] Define event store schema and indexing strategies
- [x] Document event replay and projection patterns
- [x] Specify event versioning and migration strategies
- [x] Define performance requirements and benchmarks
- [x] Document plugin integration for event handlers
- [x] Include testing strategies for event-driven systems
- [x] Provide implementation examples and patterns
- [x] Document monitoring and observability requirements

## Technical Notes
Build on existing implementation:
- Event sourcing foundation from IMPL-004
- Performance insights from PERF-003 baselines
- Type safety improvements from REFACTOR-005

Focus areas:
- Event store optimization patterns
- Event replay mechanisms
- Snapshot strategies
- Cross-aggregate event handling
- Event schema evolution

Target length: 600-900 lines with:
- Complete event interfaces
- Storage and indexing patterns
- API endpoint definitions
- Performance benchmarks
- Monitoring requirements

## Dependencies
- IMPL-004: Event Engine Foundation (completed)
- PERF-003: Performance baselines (planned)
- Architecture documentation review

## Testing Strategy
- Technical review by architecture team
- Validation against existing implementation
- Performance requirement validation
- LLM agent readability testing

## Definition of Done
- [x] Event engine specification file created
- [x] All interfaces and patterns documented
- [x] Event store schema specified
- [x] Performance requirements defined
- [x] Plugin integration points documented
- [x] Implementation examples included
- [x] Technical review passed
- [x] Review feedback applied

## Review Fixes Applied

Applied three minor enhancements from PR #12 review feedback (2025-09-26):

1. **Line 159 - Concurrency Patterns**: Expanded concurrency control description to specify exact patterns handled:
   - Optimistic concurrency control
   - Lost update prevention
   - Eventual consistency patterns

2. **Line 312 - Debugging Examples**: Added concrete debugging examples for event replay:
   - User-specific event debugging with replay by aggregateId
   - State reconstruction at specific points in time
   - Performance analysis with timing metrics
   - Bug investigation using correlation tracing

3. **Lines 341-345 - Migration Content**: Replaced placeholder text with detailed migration strategies:
   - Additive changes with code examples
   - Upgrade transformation patterns
   - Version negotiation interfaces
   - Breaking change handling procedures
   - Migration windows and rollback support

**Result**: Enhanced specification clarity and completeness while maintaining the excellent technical depth acknowledged in the review. All original 51 specification validation tests continue to pass.
