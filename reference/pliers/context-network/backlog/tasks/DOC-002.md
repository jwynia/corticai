# DOC-002: Create Missing Core Component Specifications

## Metadata
- **Status:** archived
- **Type:** doc
- **Epic:** phase-1-foundation
- **Priority:** high
- **Size:** xl
- **Created:** 2025-01-22
- **Updated:** 2025-01-22

## Branch Info
- **Branch:** [will be set during implementation]
- **Worktree:** [will be set during implementation]
- **PR:** #pending

## Description
**ARCHIVED**: This task was too large and has been broken down into manageable subtasks.

Original scope: Most core component specifications referenced in the index are marked as "to be created". These detailed specifications are critical for LLM agents to implement the system correctly in Phase 2.

## Subtasks Created
- [DOC-002-8](DOC-002-8.md) - Create Form Engine Specification (ready)
- [DOC-002-9](DOC-002-9.md) - Create Event Engine Specification (ready)

## Remaining Components (Future Tasks)
- Submission Engine specification
- Workflow Engine specification
- Plugin Engine specification
- Search Engine specification
- AI Engine specification

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create form_engine.md with complete Zod schemas and interfaces
- [ ] Create submission_engine.md with storage patterns and validation logic
- [ ] Create workflow_engine.md with state machine specifications
- [ ] Create event_engine.md with event sourcing patterns
- [ ] Create plugin_engine.md with lifecycle and priority systems
- [ ] Create search_engine.md with query optimization strategies
- [ ] Create ai_engine.md with LLM integration patterns
- [ ] Each specification includes:
  - [ ] Complete TypeScript interfaces
  - [ ] Database schema requirements
  - [ ] API contracts
  - [ ] Performance requirements
  - [ ] Error handling patterns
  - [ ] Testing strategies

## Technical Notes
- Each component file should be 500-1000 lines with comprehensive detail
- Include code examples and implementation patterns
- Define clear boundaries and interfaces between components
- Specify plugin integration points

## Dependencies
- Technology stack decisions
- Architecture documentation review

## Testing Strategy
- Technical review by architecture team
- Validation that specifications are implementable
- LLM agent readability testing
