# IMPL-003-1: Authentication System Assessment

## Metadata
- **Status:** ready
- **Type:** research
- **Epic:** phase-2-core-engines
- **Priority:** high
- **Size:** small
- **Created:** 2025-10-02
- **Parent:** IMPL-003 (decomposed)

## Branch Info
- **Branch:** [not yet created]
- **Worktree:** [not yet created]
- **PR:** [not yet created]

## Description
Assess the current state of authentication in the codebase, categorize existing references, and create a clear implementation roadmap for the authentication system. This assessment will inform all subsequent implementation tasks.

## Context
IMPL-003 was a large task (14 acceptance criteria) covering authentication, authorization, RBAC, multi-tenancy, and security hardening. This assessment phase will:
- Understand what currently exists vs what's missing
- Categorize the types of work needed (build fixes, new features, security hardening)
- Define clear boundaries between subsystems
- Create a safe implementation sequence

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Catalog all existing auth-related code references in codebase
- [ ] Identify missing vs. incomplete vs. working auth components
- [ ] Document current database schema for users/roles/permissions
- [ ] Map all auth-related dependencies and integration points
- [ ] Create detailed implementation sequence for remaining subtasks

## Technical Notes

### Areas to Investigate
1. **Existing Auth Code**
   - Search for auth imports in app.ts and other files
   - Check if any auth middleware exists
   - Look for user models, role models, permission models

2. **Database Schema**
   - Review existing user-related tables
   - Check for role/permission tables
   - Identify multi-tenancy schema patterns

3. **Dependencies**
   - Check package.json for auth libraries (jose, bcrypt, etc.)
   - Identify missing security dependencies
   - Review existing middleware patterns

4. **Integration Points**
   - API routes that need authentication
   - WebSocket authentication requirements
   - Service-to-service communication needs

### Deliverables
Create a detailed assessment document that answers:
- What auth functionality already exists?
- What's referenced but not implemented?
- What build/compilation errors exist?
- What's the cleanest implementation sequence?
- What are the critical security requirements?

## Branch Naming
**Suggested Branch:** `task/IMPL-003-1-auth-assessment`

## Dependencies
- ✅ IMPL-001: Database setup (COMPLETED)
- ✅ DOC-005: Security architecture (COMPLETED)
- ✅ DOC-003-1: Core database schema (COMPLETED)

## Testing Strategy
- No code changes in this task
- Document existing tests related to authentication
- Identify gaps in test coverage
- Define testing approach for implementation tasks

## Follow-up Tasks
- IMPL-003-2: JWT Authentication Foundation
- IMPL-003-3: Token Management and Refresh
- IMPL-003-4: RBAC System Implementation
- IMPL-003-5: Multi-Tenancy Row-Level Security
- IMPL-003-6: Security Hardening
- IMPL-003-7: Extended Authentication Methods

## Estimated Effort
- **Time:** 2-4 hours
- **Complexity:** Small (research and documentation)
- **Risk:** Low (no code changes)
