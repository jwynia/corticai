- **PR:** #pending

## Description
Create comprehensive specification for the Workflow Engine, the core orchestration component that manages submission lifecycle, state transitions, approvals, and long-running processes.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Workflow definition schema with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] State machine specification with transition rules
- [x] Approval chain configuration documented
- [x] Parallel and sequential step execution patterns
- [x] Conditional branching logic defined
- [x] Timeout and escalation handling specified
- [x] Workflow versioning strategy documented
- [x] Event triggers and hooks defined
- [x] Integration with Event Engine specified
- [x] API endpoints for workflow operations
- [x] Workflow monitoring and debugging interfaces

## Technical Notes
- Implement as finite state machine with guards
- Support both synchronous and async transitions
- Enable workflow composition and sub-workflows
- Store workflow state in dedicated tables
- Support workflow migration between versions

## Dependencies
- DOC-002-2: Submission Engine specification (completed)
- DOC-002-4: Event Engine specification (completed)
- DOC-001: Foundation structure (completed)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for state transitions
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Performance tests for parallel execution
- Stress tests for long-running workflows

## Completion Summary
- **Completed:** 2025-01-22
- **Completed By:** Claude/DOC-002-3 Implementation
- **Files Created:**
  - `/workspaces/pliers/context-network/foundation/components/workflow-engine/specification.md` - Main specification document
  - `/workspaces/pliers/context-network/foundation/components/workflow-engine/schema.ts` - TypeScript interfaces and types
  - `/workspaces/pliers/context-network/foundation/components/workflow-engine/examples.md` - Practical examples and use cases
  - `/workspaces/pliers/context-network/foundation/components/workflow-engine/api.md` - REST API endpoint specifications

## Implementation Details
The Workflow Engine specification has been completed with comprehensive documentation covering:
- Complete finite state machine architecture with guards, transitions, and actions
- Sophisticated approval chain system with escalation and delegation
- Parallel and sequential execution patterns with timeout handling
- Conditional branching logic with multiple evaluation strategies
- Sub-workflow composition and nested execution support
- Event integration with the Event Engine for triggers and hooks
- SLA management with automatic escalation and breach detection
- Comprehensive REST API with GraphQL support and WebSocket events
- Real-time monitoring and debugging interfaces
- Enterprise-grade features including versioning, migration, and compliance

All acceptance criteria have been fully addressed with implementation-ready specifications suitable for LLM agent development.
