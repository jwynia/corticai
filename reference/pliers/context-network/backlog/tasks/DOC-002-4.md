- **Size:** medium
- **Created:** 2025-01-22
- **Updated:** 2025-01-22
- **Groomed:** 2025-01-22

## Branch Info
- **Branch:** feat/doc-002-4-event-engine-spec
- **Worktree:** [will be set during implementation]
- **PR:** #pending

## Description
Create comprehensive specification for the Event Engine, implementing event sourcing for audit trails, plugin processing, and system integration.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Event schema with TypeScript interfaces
- [x] Event store design for PostgreSQL
- [x] Event publishing and subscription patterns
- [x] Event replay and projection mechanisms
- [x] Plugin hook system specification
- [x] Event filtering and routing rules
- [x] Dead letter queue handling
- [x] Event compaction strategy
- [x] API for event queries and replay
- [x] Integration with other engines documented

## Technical Notes
- Implement append-only event log
- Support event versioning and migration
- Enable event replay for debugging
- Provide event streaming via WebSockets
- Maintain event ordering guarantees

### Research-Enhanced Implementation Patterns (2025-09-23)

#### Event Sourcing Architecture
- **Transactional Outbox Pattern**: Ensure reliable event publishing
  ```sql
  -- Events and outbox in same transaction
  BEGIN;
    INSERT INTO events (...) VALUES (...);
    INSERT INTO outbox (...) VALUES (...);
  COMMIT;
  ```
- **PostgreSQL LISTEN/NOTIFY**: Real-time event notifications
- **Event Store Schema**: Optimized for append-only operations with proper indexing

#### Saga Pattern Implementation
- **Choreography**: For simple workflows (services react to events)
- **Orchestration**: For complex multi-step processes (central coordinator)
- **Compensating Transactions**: Handle rollback scenarios
- **Idempotency**: Ensure operations can be safely retried

#### Critical Considerations
- **Event Ordering**: Use aggregate versioning and sequence numbers
- **Performance**: Implement snapshots every N events
- **Schema Evolution**: Version events from day one
- **Failure Handling**: Dead letter queue with exponential backoff

See [Event Sourcing Research](../../discoveries/records/2025-09-23-technical-research.md#postgresql-event-sourcing--saga-patterns) for detailed patterns.

## Dependencies
- DOC-001: Foundation structure (completed)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for event processing
- Integration tests for event flow
- Performance tests for high-volume events
- Reliability tests for event ordering

## Completion Notes
**Completed:** 2025-01-22

All acceptance criteria have been fulfilled:

### Created Files:
1. **specification.md** (1,104 lines) - Main specification document with comprehensive event engine architecture
2. **schema.ts** (982 lines) - TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas for type safety
3. **examples.md** (1,504 lines) - Practical examples and implementation patterns
4. **api.md** (1,479 lines) - REST API and WebSocket specifications

### Key Features Documented:
- Complete event sourcing architecture with PostgreSQL storage
- Comprehensive TypeScript schema definitions with Zod validation
- Plugin system with priority-based execution and error handling
- Event routing and filtering with webhook integrations
- Dead letter queue management with retry strategies
- Event compaction for storage optimization
- Real-time WebSocket streaming with subscription management
- Full REST API with authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
- Integration patterns with Form Engine, Submission Engine, and Plugin Engine
- Performance monitoring and health check endpoints

The documentation provides implementation-ready specifications that LLM agents can use to build the Event Engine independently.
