# SEC-004: Add WebSocket Authentication and Authorization

## Metadata
- **Status:** completed
- **Type:** security
- **Epic:** security-hardening
- **Priority:** critical
- **Size:** medium
- **Created:** 2025-09-23
- **Updated:** 2025-09-24
- **Completed:** 2025-09-24
- **PR:** #6 (merged)
- **Branch:** task/SEC-004-websocket-auth (deleted)
- **Worktree:** .worktrees/SEC-004/ (removed)

## Description
The Event Engine WebSocket implementation lacks authentication and authorization, allowing unauthorized access to event streams. This is a critical security vulnerability identified during code review.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Implement token-based authentication for WebSocket connections
- [x] Add authorization checks for event subscriptions
- [x] Validate WebSocket origin to prevent CORS bypass
- [x] Implement rate limiting for incoming messages
- [x] Add connection timeout and cleanup
- [x] Validate and sanitize all incoming messages
- [x] Add comprehensive security tests
- [x] Document authentication flow

## Technical Notes
- Use JWT tokens for authentication
- Implement per-user permission checking for event types
- Add configurable rate limits
- Consider using existing auth middleware
- Store user context in WebSocket connection

## Dependencies
- IMPL-004: Event Engine Foundation (completed)
- Existing authentication system

## Security Impact
- **Current Risk:** CRITICAL - Unauthorized access to all events
- **Post-Fix Risk:** LOW - Properly secured event streaming

## Testing Strategy
- Test authentication with valid/invalid tokens
- Test authorization for different event types
- Test rate limiting behavior
- Test CORS and origin validation
- Test connection cleanup on timeout

## Implementation Notes
```typescript
// Example implementation approach
interface AuthenticatedWebSocket extends WebSocket {
  user: AuthenticatedUser;
  rateLimiter: RateLimiter;
  permissions: EventPermissions;
}

private async authenticateWebSocket(ws: WebSocket, req: IncomingMessage): Promise<boolean> {
  const token = extractToken(req);
  const user = await verifyToken(token);
  if (!user) {
    ws.close(1008, 'Authentication required');
    return false;
  }
  (ws as AuthenticatedWebSocket).user = user;
  return true;
}
```

## Estimated Effort
- Implementation: 4-6 hours
- Testing: 2-3 hours
- Documentation: 1 hour
