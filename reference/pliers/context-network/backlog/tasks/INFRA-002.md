## Metadata
- **Status:** completed
- **Type:** infra
- **Epic:** infrastructure
- **Priority:** critical
- **Size:** medium
- **Created:** 2025-09-27
- **Updated:** 2025-09-27
- **Completed:** 2025-09-27

## Branch Info
- **Branch:** task/infra-002-testing-infrastructure (merged)
- **Worktree:** .worktrees/infra-002 (removed)
- **PR:** #21 (merged)

## Description
Setup Jest + TestContainers testing infrastructure for reliable local development testing. Focus is on creating a rock-solid local testing foundation that developers can rely on consistently, with CI/CD integration deferred to a later task.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Jest configured with TypeScript support for local development
- [ ] TestContainers setup for PostgreSQL integration tests (local only)
- [ ] Test coverage reporting configured (local reporting)
- [ ] Test database seeding and cleanup automation (workstation)
- [ ] Performance testing framework setup (local benchmarking)
- [ ] Unit tests run reliably with `npm test`
- [ ] Integration tests run consistently with `npm run test:integration`
- [ ] Coverage reports generated locally and meet thresholds (80% minimum)
- [ ] Test database isolation verified on workstation
- [ ] Tests consistently stay green locally across team members

## Technical Specifications

### Jest Configuration
```typescript
// jest.config.js structure
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  roots: ['<rootDir>/apps', '<rootDir>/packages'],
  testMatch: ['**/__tests__/**/*.test.ts'],
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: 80
    }
  },
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/test/setup.ts']
};
```

### TestContainers Setup
- Use @testcontainers/postgresql for isolated database testing
- Configure test database seeding and cleanup
- Environment variable management for test configuration
- Connection pooling for test performance

### Test Structure
```
test/
├── setup.ts              # Global test setup
├── fixtures/              # Test data fixtures
├── helpers/               # Test utility functions
└── __utils__/            # Shared test utilities

apps/api/src/
├── __tests__/            # Unit tests
└── __integration__/      # Integration tests
```

### Performance Testing
- Basic benchmarking utilities
- Database query performance tests
- Memory usage monitoring in tests
- Test execution time tracking

## Dependencies
- INFRA-001 (✅ completed - Development Environment Setup)
- Node.js/TypeScript monorepo structure
- PostgreSQL Docker setup

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All test commands work locally on every developer machine
- [ ] Test isolation prevents test interference
- [ ] Clear test failure messages with actionable information
- [ ] Test execution is fast (unit tests < 30s, integration < 2min)
- [ ] Test coverage reports are accurate and useful
- [ ] Documentation exists for running and writing tests
- [ ] Example tests demonstrate testing patterns
- [ ] No flaky tests - consistent results across runs

## Testing Strategy
This task follows test-driven development:
1. Write tests for the testing infrastructure itself
2. Create configuration files to pass those tests
3. Verify test commands work as expected
4. Create example tests to validate the framework
5. Document testing patterns and conventions

## Scope Limitations
**NOT included in this task (deferred to INFRA-007):**
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- GitHub Actions setup
- Remote test execution
- Automated deployment testing

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on developer experience and local reliability
- Prioritize fast feedback loops for local development
- Ensure consistent behavior across different developer environments
- Document any environment-specific setup requirements

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero test setup friction for new developers
- [ ] Consistent test results across all team member machines
- [ ] Fast test execution enables frequent running
- [ ] Clear test failure debugging information
- [ ] High developer confidence in test results

## Next Steps After Completion
- INFRA-003: Database Schema Foundation
- INFRA-007: CI/CD Testing Pipeline (future task)
- Begin TDD implementation of Form Engine components
