# PROC-001: Implement TDD Process Standards

## Metadata
- **Status:** ready
- **Type:** process
- **Epic:** development-standards
- **Priority:** medium
- **Size:** small
- **Created:** 2025-09-23
- **Updated:** 2025-09-23

## Description
Formalize Test-Driven Development as the standard approach for critical components based on the success demonstrated in IMPL-004. Create tooling and processes to support TDD adoption.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define components requiring mandatory TDD
- [ ] Create TDD checklist for PRs
- [ ] Add TDD templates to project
- [ ] Create VS Code snippets for test structures
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks for test coverage
- [ ] Document TDD workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Create TDD training materials
- [ ] Define coverage thresholds per component type

## Technical Notes
- Leverage existing test infrastructure (Vitest)
- Consider test generation tools
- Integrate with CI/CD pipeline
- Add coverage badges to README

## Implementation Steps
1. **Policy Definition**:
   - Core business logic: Mandatory TDD
   - Security code: Mandatory TDD
   - Public APIs: Mandatory TDD
   - UI components: Optional TDD

2. **Tooling Setup**:
   ```json
   // .vscode/snippets/tdd.code-snippets
   {
     "TDD Test Suite": {
       "prefix": "tdd",
       "body": [
         "describe('${1:ComponentName}', () => {",
         "  let ${2:instance}: ${1};",
         "",
         "  beforeEach(() => {",
         "    ${2} = new ${1}();",
         "  });",
         "",
         "  describe('${3:methodName}', () => {",
         "    it('should ${4:behavior description}', () => {",
         "      // Arrange",
         "      const input = ${5:testData};",
         "",
         "      // Act",
         "      const result = ${2}.${3}(input);",
         "",
         "      // Assert",
         "      expect(result).toBe(${6:expected});",
         "    });",
         "  });",
         "});"
       ]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **PR Checklist**:
   ```markdown
   ## TDD Checklist (for critical components)
   - [ ] Tests written before implementation
   - [ ] All tests initially failed
   - [ ] Coverage > 80%
   - [ ] Tests are meaningful (not tautological)
   - [ ] Edge cases covered
   ```

## Dependencies
- TDD Process Guide already created
- Team buy-in for process change

## Success Metrics
- TDD adoption rate > 70% for critical components
- Defect rate reduction > 30%
- Test coverage improvement > 20%
- Developer satisfaction with process

## Estimated Effort
- Policy documentation: 1 hour
- Tooling setup: 2 hours
- Training materials: 2 hours
- Rollout support: Ongoing

## Source
- Recommendation from IMPL-004 retrospective
- Success demonstrated with 300+ test TDD approach
