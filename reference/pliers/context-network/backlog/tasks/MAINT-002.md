# MAINT-002: Split Oversized Documentation Files

## Metadata
- **Status:** ready
- **Type:** maintenance
- **Epic:** infrastructure
- **Priority:** medium
- **Size:** large
- **Created:** 2025-09-27
- **Branch:** task/MAINT-002-split-large-files

## Description
Split 3 documentation files that exceed 1500-line guidelines into logical, navigable components while maintaining content relationships and cross-references.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Split `workflow-engine/examples.md` (3,720 lines) into example categories
- [ ] Split `form-engine/examples.md` (2,794 lines) into form type examples
- [ ] Split `workflow-engine/api.md` (2,392 lines) into API functional areas
- [ ] Create index files for each split content area
- [ ] Preserve all internal cross-references
- [ ] Update navigation and discovery documents
- [ ] Ensure split maintains logical content groupings

## Original Recommendation
From Context Network Audit: "Split oversized files - Break 3 largest files into logical components"

## Risk Assessment
**Risk Level:** Medium
- Complex internal linking could break
- Content relationships need preservation
- Large files may have interdependent content

## Dependencies
- Need to understand content structure and relationships within each file
- Must maintain API documentation accuracy
- Should follow hierarchical organization patterns

## Effort Estimate
- **Time:** 2-3 hours total (45-60 minutes per file)
- **Complexity:** Large (content analysis + restructuring)
- **Testing:** Verify all examples work and references are intact

## Implementation Strategy
1. Analyze each file's content structure and natural break points
2. Create hierarchical organization plan for each
3. Split content maintaining logical groupings
4. Update all cross-references and navigation
5. Test that all examples and references still work
