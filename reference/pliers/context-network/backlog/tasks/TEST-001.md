# TEST-001: Define Testing Strategy and Standards

## Metadata
- **Status:** completed
- **Type:** test
- **Epic:** phase-1-foundation
- **Priority:** high
- **Size:** medium
- **Created:** 2025-01-22
- **Updated:** 2025-01-26
- **Completed:** 2025-09-26

## Branch Info
- **Branch:** task/TEST-001-testing-strategy
- **Worktree:** .worktrees/TEST-001/
- **PR:** #14 (merged)

## Description
While testing is mentioned in Phase 2 tasks, there's no comprehensive testing strategy documentation for LLM agents to follow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Define unit testing standards and patterns
- [ ] Document integration testing approach
- [ ] Specify end-to-end testing scenarios
- [ ] Define performance testing benchmarks
- [ ] Document load testing requirements
- [ ] Specify test data management strategy
- [ ] Define test coverage requirements
- [ ] Include:
  - [ ] Testing framework choices (Jest, TestContainers)
  - [ ] Mocking and stubbing patterns
  - [ ] Test naming conventions
  - [ ] Test organization structure
  - [ ] CI/CD test pipeline
  - [ ] Test reporting requirements

## Technical Notes
**Testing Framework Stack**:
- Unit/Integration: Vitest (already established)
- E2E Testing: Playwright or similar
- API Testing: Supertest or similar
- Database Testing: TestContainers
- Load Testing: k6 or Artillery

**Test Pyramid Strategy**:
- 70% Unit Tests (fast, isolated)
- 20% Integration Tests (module boundaries)
- 10% E2E Tests (user workflows)

## Implementation Approach
1. **Standards Documentation**: Create testing-standards.md
2. **Framework Setup**: Configure testing tools and scripts
3. **Template Creation**: Provide test templates for each layer
4. **CI Integration**: Add testing to build pipeline
5. **Coverage Setup**: Implement coverage reporting

## Suggested File Structure
```

├── testing-standards.md         # Main testing strategy doc
├── unit-testing-guide.md        # Unit test patterns

```

## Dependencies
- Component specifications (in progress)
- API documentation (partial)
- Testing framework selection (can be decided during implementation)

## Success Metrics
- All new code has 80%+ test coverage
- Critical paths have 95%+ test coverage
- Test execution time < 5 minutes
- Zero false positives in CI tests

## Estimated Effort
- Standards documentation: 4-6 hours
- Template creation: 2-3 hours
- CI integration: 2-3 hours
- Team training: 2 hours

## Testing Strategy
- Technical review by development team
- Validate with existing codebase patterns
- Ensure LLM agents can follow guidelines
