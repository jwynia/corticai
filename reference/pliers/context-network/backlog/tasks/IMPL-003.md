# IMPL-003: Authentication and Authorization System (ARCHIVED - DECOMPOSED)

## Metadata
- **Status:** archived
- **Type:** feat
- **Epic:** phase-2-core-engines
- **Priority:** high
- **Size:** large (OVERSIZED - exceeded context window constraints)
- **Created:** 2025-01-22
- **Updated:** 2025-10-02
- **Archived:** 2025-10-02

## Archival Reason
**Task was oversized** - Decomposed into 7 context-window-sized subtasks per grooming guidelines.

### Size Violations
- ❌ Size: large (only trivial/small/medium allowed)
- ❌ Acceptance Criteria: 14 (maximum 5 allowed)
- ❌ Scope: Multiple independent subsystems
- ❌ Context Window: Would require 30+ files across multiple layers

## Decomposed Into

### Phase 1: Assessment
- **IMPL-003-1** - Authentication System Assessment (research, 2-4 hours)
  - Catalog existing auth references
  - Identify missing components
  - Define implementation sequence

### Phase 2: Foundation
- **IMPL-003-2** - JWT Authentication Foundation (1-2 days)
  - JWT token generation and validation
  - User login endpoint
  - Authentication middleware

- **IMPL-003-3** - Token Management and Refresh (1-2 days)
  - Refresh token mechanism
  - Token rotation and revocation
  - Session management

### Phase 3: Core Implementation
- **IMPL-003-4** - RBAC System Implementation (2-3 days)
  - Role and permission models
  - Authorization middleware
  - Permission inheritance

- **IMPL-003-5** - Multi-Tenancy Row-Level Security (2-3 days)
  - Tenant context management
  - Database RLS policies
  - Tenant isolation validation

### Phase 4: Security & Extension
- **IMPL-003-6** - Security Hardening and Rate Limiting (2-3 days)
  - Rate limiting per user/tenant
  - Security headers
  - Audit logging
  - Brute force protection

- **IMPL-003-7** - Extended Authentication Methods (2-3 days)
  - API key authentication
  - OAuth2/OIDC preparation
  - 2FA TOTP foundation

## Implementation Order
**MUST follow this sequence:**
1. IMPL-003-1 (Assessment) - MUST complete first
2. IMPL-003-2 (JWT Foundation) - Depends on assessment
3. IMPL-003-3 (Token Management) - Depends on IMPL-003-2
4. IMPL-003-4 (RBAC) - Depends on IMPL-003-2
5. IMPL-003-5 (Multi-Tenancy) - Depends on IMPL-003-2, IMPL-003-4
6. IMPL-003-6 (Security Hardening) - Depends on IMPL-003-2, IMPL-003-3, IMPL-003-5
7. IMPL-003-7 (Extended Auth) - Depends on IMPL-003-2, IMPL-003-4, IMPL-003-6

## Original Description
Implement comprehensive authentication and authorization system with JWT tokens, role-based access control (RBAC), and multi-tenancy support.

## Original Acceptance Criteria (14 total - EXCESSIVE)
- [ ] User authentication with JWT (access + refresh tokens) → IMPL-003-2
- [ ] Refresh token mechanism with rotation and revocation → IMPL-003-3
- [ ] Password hashing with bcrypt (cost factor 12+) → IMPL-003-2
- [ ] Role and permission models with hierarchical RBAC → IMPL-003-4
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation at row level → IMPL-003-5
- [ ] Session management with Redis (future) or memory store → IMPL-003-3
- [ ] OAuth2/OIDC integration preparation (provider agnostic) → IMPL-003-7
- [ ] API middleware for auth checks with route protection → IMPL-003-2
- [ ] Rate limiting per user/tenant with sliding window → IMPL-003-6
- [ ] Security headers implementation (CORS, CSP, HSTS) → IMPL-003-6
- [ ] 2FA foundation with TOTP support preparation → IMPL-003-7
- [ ] API key authentication for service-to-service → IMPL-003-7
- [ ] Comprehensive security tests and penetration testing → All subtasks
- [ ] Audit logging for all authentication events → IMPL-003-6

## Wave 3 Reality Check (2025-09-26)
⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This task was incorrectly reported as "implemented" during Wave 3 parallel orchestration.
**Reality:** No auth files exist in the codebase. The app.ts file imports auth modules that don't exist.
**Status:** Was reverted to "ready", now properly decomposed into implementable subtasks.

## Dependencies
- ✅ IMPL-001: Database setup (COMPLETED 2025-09-23)
- ✅ DOC-005: Security architecture (COMPLETED 2025-01-22)
- ✅ DOC-003-1: Core database schema (COMPLETED 2025-01-22)

## Lessons Learned
- Large tasks (14 acceptance criteria) cannot fit in context window
- Authentication system requires clear phase separation
- Assessment phase is critical for complex systems
- Sequential dependencies must be respected
- Each subtask now follows SOLID implementation principles
