## Description
Design the core PostgreSQL database schema including tables for organizations, users, forms, submissions, workflows, and events. Define JSONB column structures, indexing strategies, and relationships.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Submissions table with JSONB data storage
- [x] Workflows table with state management
- [x] Events table for event sourcing
- [x] Proper foreign key relationships defined
- [x] Index strategy for performance documented
- [x] Partitioning strategy for large tables
- [x] Migration scripts outlined

## Technical Notes
- Use UUID primary keys for all tables
- Implement soft deletes with deleted_at timestamps
- Add created_at, updated_at to all tables
- Use JSONB for flexible schema storage
- Design for multi-tenancy from the start

## Dependencies
- DOC-002-1 through DOC-002-7: Component specifications (all completed)

## Testing Strategy
- Schema validation tests
- Performance benchmarks for queries
- Data integrity constraint tests
- Migration rollback tests
