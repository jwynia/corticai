## Description
The Phase 2 task specifications in planning/backlogs/current.md should be split into individual task files in the backlog/tasks directory following the new task management structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Extract each Phase 2 task into individual task file
- [ ] Assign proper task IDs (INFRA-XXX, FORM-XXX, etc.)
- [ ] Update task metadata format
- [ ] Add tasks to appropriate status lists
- [ ] Create epic directories for grouping
- [ ] Update dependencies between tasks
- [ ] Maintain all technical specifications

## Technical Notes
- Preserve all technical detail from current.md
- Follow the task file template structure
- Ensure task IDs are sequential
- Update cross-references between tasks
- Each task file should be under 200 lines
- Use consistent metadata format
- Maintain atomic task principle (one clear goal per task)

## Dependencies
- Task management system structure - **In place**
- Existing Phase 2 specifications - **Available in current.md**

## Testing Strategy
- Validate all tasks are extracted
- Verify no information is lost
- Check dependency graph integrity
- Ensure all task IDs are unique
- Verify all cross-references are valid
- Check file size limits are met

## Implementation Plan
1. Parse current.md for all Phase 2 tasks
2. Create task ID mapping (old references to new IDs)
3. Extract each task to individual file
4. Update status indexes
5. Create/update epic directories
6. Validate dependency references
7. Archive original current.md section

## Estimated Time
- **Total:** 2-3 hours
- **Extraction:** 1 hour
- **Formatting:** 1 hour
- **Validation:** 30 minutes
