# PERF-001: Implement Cache Cleanup for Rate Limiter

## Metadata
- **Status:** ready
- **Type:** performance
- **Epic:** performance-optimization
- **Priority:** medium
- **Size:** medium
- **Created:** 2025-09-23

## Description
The rate limiter cache (`rateLimiterCache` Map) grows indefinitely without cleanup, which could lead to memory leaks in long-running applications. Implement proper cache expiration and cleanup mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add TTL (time-to-live) tracking for cache entries
- [ ] Implement periodic cleanup of expired entries
- [ ] Add cache size monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Implement maximum cache size limits with LRU eviction
- [ ] Add cache statistics collection
- [ ] Add tests for cache cleanup behavior
- [ ] Add monitoring for cache hit/miss rates

## Technical Notes
- Consider using a proper cache library like `node-cache` or `lru-cache`
- Implement cleanup interval (e.g., every 5 minutes)
- Track cache entry timestamps
- Add metrics for monitoring cache performance

## Implementation Approach
1. Add timestamp tracking to cache entries
2. Implement cleanup function with configurable TTL
3. Add periodic cleanup using setInterval
4. Add cache size limits and LRU eviction
5. Add monitoring and metrics

## Testing Strategy
- Test cache cleanup with expired entries
- Test cache size limits and eviction
- Performance tests for cleanup impact
- Memory leak tests for long-running scenarios

## Implementation Notes
- **Suggested Branch:** `perf/rate-limiter-cache-cleanup`
- **Estimated Time:** 3-4 hours
- **Entry Point:** Rate limiter middleware implementation

## Dependencies
- None - can be implemented independently

## Original Issue
Code review identified memory leak risk:
```typescript
const rateLimiterCache = new Map<string, RateLimiterMemory | RateLimiterRedis>();
```

Issue: Map grows indefinitely without cleanup, could lead to memory leaks.
