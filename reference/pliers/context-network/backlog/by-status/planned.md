Tasks in this state:
- Have basic description
- Need acceptance criteria refinement
- Require effort estimation
- May need technical research

**Context Window Constraints:**
- Tasks exceeding 200 lines MUST be decomposed
- Maximum 5 acceptance criteria per task
- Must fit within ~20 file examination limit
- Implementation scope < 500 lines of changes
