## Tasks Remaining in Planned (Key Items)

### Blocked by DOC-002-1
- **DOC-002-2** - Submission Engine Component Specification
  - Depends on Form Engine specification

### Blocked by Multiple DOC-002 Tasks
- **DOC-002-3** - Workflow Engine Component Specification
  - Depends on DOC-002-2 (Submission) and DOC-002-4 (Event)
- **DOC-002-5** - Plugin Engine Component Specification
  - Depends on DOC-002-4 (Event Engine)
- **DOC-003-1** - Core Database Schema Design
  - Depends on all DOC-002 component specifications
- **DOC-003-2** - JSONB Schema Patterns and Validation
  - Depends on DOC-003-1

### Implementation Tasks (Phase 2)
- **IMPL-001** through **IMPL-004**
  - All depend on Phase 1 documentation being complete

## Ready Queue Summary

### High Priority (5 tasks)
- TASK-001 - Set Up GitHub CLI Authentication
- DOC-002-1 - Form Engine Component Specification
- DOC-002-4 - Event Engine Component Specification
- DOC-005 - Create Security Architecture Documentation
- TEST-001-1 - Unit Testing Strategy and Standards

### Medium Priority
- None in ready status

### Low Priority
- None in ready status

## Recommended Next Actions

### Immediate Implementation Candidates
1. **TASK-001** - Quick win for GitHub CLI setup
2. **DOC-002-1** - Critical foundation piece that unblocks other work
3. **DOC-002-4** - Can be done in parallel with DOC-002-1

### Tasks That Will Unblock Most Work
- **DOC-002-1** completion will unblock:
  - DOC-002-2 (Submission Engine)
  - Which then unblocks DOC-002-3 (Workflow Engine)
  - And subsequently DOC-003-1 (Database Schema)

### Parallel Work Opportunities
These can be worked on simultaneously:
- DOC-002-1 (Form Engine)
- DOC-002-4 (Event Engine)
- DOC-005 (Security Architecture)
- TEST-001-1 (Unit Testing Strategy)

## Observations

1. **Dependency Chain:** Most Phase 2 implementation tasks are blocked by Phase 1 documentation, creating a critical path through DOC-002 specifications.

2. **Documentation First:** The project correctly prioritizes specification documentation before implementation, ensuring LLM agents have clear guidance.

3. **Parallel Opportunities:** Multiple documentation tasks can proceed in parallel since they don't have interdependencies.

## Next Grooming Session Focus

For the next grooming session, focus on:
1. Tasks that will be unblocked once DOC-002-1 and DOC-002-4 are complete
2. Review of medium-priority tasks that could be promoted
3. Breaking down any tasks marked as "large" into smaller chunks
