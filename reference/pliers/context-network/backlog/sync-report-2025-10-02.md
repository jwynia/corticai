  - File exists: `apps/web/src/services/device-capabilities.ts`
  - Test file: `apps/web/src/services/__tests__/device-capabilities.test.ts`
  - 42 comprehensive test cases
  - WebAuthn/Passkey support detection

- **Action:** ✅ Moved to completed.md

### 🎯 WEB-005-1: Form Designer API Foundation (PR #25)
- **Merge Date:** 2025-09-30
- **Evidence:**
  - PR #25 merged implementing REST API for form designer
  - Modified files: forms.routes.ts, forms.service.ts, forms schema
  - Complete CRUD endpoints for forms
  - Database seeding with form data
- **Drift:** Listed as "ready" but merged 3 days ago
- **Action:** ✅ Moved to completed.md

## Drift Analysis

### 📉 Status File Lag Pattern - 7 Days
**Root Cause:** Rapid development velocity (8 PRs merged in one day) outpaced status file maintenance.

**Timeline:**
- Oct 2, 2025 04:08 - First IMPL-003 PR merged (#27)
- Oct 2, 2025 14:11 - Last IMPL-003 PR merged (#34)
- Oct 2, 2025 afternoon - Sync detected all 8 PRs undocumented
- **Gap:** Same day, but status files not updated during implementation

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Planning Disruption:** **CRITICAL** - Entire auth system showing as "ready" could lead to duplicate work
- **Progress Visibility:** **HIGH** - Major milestone (authentication system) invisible to stakeholders
- **Resource Allocation:** **LOW** - Individual task files correctly marked as completed in PRs
- **Team Coordination:** **MEDIUM** - Other developers might pick up "ready" tasks already done

### 🔄 Drift Patterns Identified

1. **High-Velocity Development Days**
   - 8 PRs merged in single day (Oct 2)
   - Status file updates deferred during rapid merging
   - Context network lags behind actual state

2. **Decomposed Task Completion**
   - Parent task (IMPL-003) decomposed into 7 subtasks
   - All subtasks completed rapidly in sequence
   - Status files not updated until all complete

3. **Cross-Epic Completions**
   - WEB-007-2 and WEB-005-1 from different epics
   - Both completed but not reflected in status tracking

### 💡 Process Improvement Opportunities

1. **Post-Merge Status Hook** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - Add step to merge workflow: Update context-network/backlog/by-status/
   - Template: "When merging PR for TASK-XXX, move task from ready.md to completed.md"

2. **Daily Sync Cadence** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
   - Run `/sync` at end of each development day
   - Catch drift within 24 hours instead of 7 days

3. **PR Description Template Enhancement** (LOW PRIORITY)
   - Add checkbox: "[] Updated task status in context network"
   - Reminder to update status files as part of PR process

4. **Automated Drift Detection** (FUTURE)
   - Script to compare merged PRs with ready.md
   - Alert when drift exceeds threshold

## Ambiguous Status: TEST-002

### 🔍 Investigation Results
- **Task File Status:** "in-review" with "Implementation complete" noted
- **PR Search Result:** No PR found matching "TEST-002"
- **Evidence in Task File:**
  - Comprehensive implementation summary
  - Validation results showing 80 passing tests
  - Detailed changes to jest configs and test structure
  - Date: 2025-10-01

### 🤔 Possible Scenarios
1. **Work completed directly on main** - Changes merged without PR
2. **PR number mismatch** - PR exists but not tagged with TEST-002
3. **Implementation completed but not committed** - Work done locally, not yet pushed
4. **Status error in task file** - Implementation not actually complete

### ✋ Recommended Action
**HUMAN REVIEW REQUIRED** - Check with developer who worked on TEST-002:
- Was a PR created? If yes, what number?
- Were changes merged directly to main?
- Should task be moved to completed or remain in-review?

**Temporary Action Taken:**
- Updated in-review.md with note about ambiguous status
- Flagged for manual verification
- No automatic status change applied
