- **Scope:** 5 new tasks created (AUTH-001 through AUTH-005)
- **Implementation:** Comprehensive research documentation and task planning
- **Files Created:**
  - `/context-network/research/passwordless-auth-passkeys-magic-links/` (5 documents)
  - `/context-network/plans/passwordless-authentication-implementation.md`
  - `/context-network/foundation/security/architecture.md`
  - 5 AUTH task files with detailed acceptance criteria
- **Action:** ‚úÖ Added AUTH-004 and AUTH-005 to ready.md

## Drift Analysis

### üìâ Status File Lag Pattern
**Root Cause:** Status index files (`ready.md`, `completed.md`) not updated when individual task files marked complete.

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Planning Disruption:** Medium - Could lead to duplicate work assignment
- **Progress Visibility:** High - Stakeholders missing 4 major security completions
- **Resource Allocation:** Low - Tasks still correctly marked in individual files
- **Team Morale:** Medium - Completed work not properly celebrated

### üîÑ Process Improvement Opportunities

1. **Automated Status Sync:** Consider tool to sync individual task status to index files
2. **PR Completion Hooks:** Update status files as part of merge process
3. **Regular Sync Intervals:** Weekly sync process to catch drift early
4. **Status File Validation:** Add checks for consistency between task files and indexes
