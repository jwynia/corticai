- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Process Documents

### Core Processes
- [**Creation Process**](creation.md) - How to create new elements and content
- [**Validation Process**](validation.md) - Quality assurance and testing procedures
- [**Delivery Process**](delivery.md) - Release and deployment workflows
- [**Document Integration**](document_integration.md) - Process for integrating new documents

### Specialized Workflows

- **PR Workflow Clarification**: Created comprehensive documentation defining agent capabilities and human review requirements
- **Process Boundary Definition**: Clear separation of automated vs. human responsibilities
- **Security Review Process**: Established procedures for security fix validation

### Key Process Principles
1. **Human Review Gate**: All code changes require human approval before merge
2. **Test-First Development**: Tests written before implementation across all workflows
3. **Documentation Parity**: Process changes require corresponding documentation updates
4. **Context Network Integration**: All planning and coordination through context network
