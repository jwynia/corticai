## Lessons Learned

### 1. TDD Works for Complex Systems
The approach of writing comprehensive tests first proved highly effective:
- Forced clear thinking about API design
- Caught edge cases early
- Made implementation straightforward
- Enabled confident refactoring

### 2. Security Review Critical
Post-implementation security review revealed significant issues that testing alone didn't catch:
- Authentication/authorization gaps
- Resource exhaustion risks
- Input validation needs

### 3. Smart Triage Reduces Risk
Not all issues need immediate fixes:
- Simple fixes: Do immediately
- Complex changes: Create tasks
- Research needed: Document and plan

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Decisions

#### ADR-001: Event Store as Append-Only Log
**Status**: Implemented
**Decision**: Use append-only log pattern for event storage
**Rationale**: Immutability, audit trail, replay capability
**Trade-offs**: Storage growth, query performance

#### ADR-002: Async Event Handlers with Retry
**Status**: Implemented
**Decision**: All handlers async with configurable retry
**Rationale**: Resilience, non-blocking operations
**Trade-offs**: Complexity, eventual consistency

#### ADR-003: Plugin Hooks for Extensibility
**Status**: Implemented (needs sandboxing)
**Decision**: Hook-based plugin system
**Rationale**: Extensibility without core changes
**Trade-offs**: Security risks, performance overhead

#### ADR-004: WebSocket for Real-time Events
**Status**: Implemented (needs auth)
**Decision**: WebSocket streaming for live events
**Rationale**: Real-time updates, efficient push
**Trade-offs**: Connection management, auth complexity

## Recommendations Applied

### Applied Immediately (2)
- **TDD Process Guide**: Documented successful approach
- **Sprint Priorities**: Created security-focused plan

### Deferred to Tasks (3)
- **Database Migration Guide**: DOC-008 created
- **Performance Baselines**: PERF-003 created
- **TDD Standards**: PROC-001 created

## Key Insights

### 1. TDD as Risk Reduction
Writing tests first dramatically reduced implementation risk and debugging time. The upfront investment paid off immediately.

### 2. Security Cannot Be Tested In
Security issues like missing authentication aren't caught by functional tests. Dedicated security review is essential.

### 3. Triage Prevents Perfection Paralysis
Smart triage of issues into "fix now" vs "task later" kept momentum while managing risk.

### 4. Documentation Debt Accumulates
Each implementation without docs makes the next implementation harder. Documentation should be part of definition of done.

## Follow-up Required

### Immediate (Next Sprint)
1. Implement SEC-004 (WebSocket Auth) - CRITICAL
2. Create DOC-008 (DB Migration Guide)
3. Establish PERF-003 (Performance Baselines)

### Soon (2-3 Sprints)
1. Implement SEC-005 (Plugin Sandboxing)
2. Complete PERF-002 (Event Indexing)
3. Deploy PROC-001 (TDD Standards)

### Eventually
1. REFACTOR-004 (Structured Logging)
2. Operational documentation
3. Performance optimization

## Success Criteria Met
