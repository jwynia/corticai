### Project Overview

**Pliers** is a general-purpose forms and data application framework designed to track work through long-running workflows. The system centers around flexible form definitions that define data fields, hierarchical relationships, and workflow status definitions. This is the third iteration of the concept, originally developed in 2009, now being rebuilt with modern development approaches and integrated LLM AI capabilities.

### Vision Statement

Create a flexible, AI-enhanced workflow management platform that adapts to any organization's data collection and business process needs through configurable forms and intelligent automation.

### Mission Statement

Pliers provides organizations with a powerful framework for defining custom forms, managing data relationships, and orchestrating complex workflows through an event-driven plugin architecture, enhanced by modern AI capabilities for form design, workflow automation, and data analysis.

### Project Objectives

1. **Modern Architecture Rebuild**: Redesign the system using contemporary technologies (PostgreSQL with JSONB, TypeScript/Zod schemas, vector search) to replace legacy EAV SQL Server and MongoDB hybrid approach
2. **AI Integration**: Integrate LLM capabilities for intelligent form design, automated workflow orchestration, smart data analysis, and adaptive plugin development
3. **Agent-Ready Development**: Structure the entire codebase and documentation to enable LLM agents to work effectively on well-defined, contextualized tasks

### Success Criteria

1. **Functional Parity Plus Enhancement**: Achieve all capabilities of previous iterations while significantly improving performance, flexibility, and user experience
2. **AI-Enhanced Workflows**: Demonstrate measurable improvements in form design speed, workflow automation accuracy, and data insights through AI integration
3. **Developer Productivity**: Enable LLM agents to successfully complete development tasks using comprehensive context documentation and well-groomed backlogs

### Project Scope

#### In Scope

- Core form definition and data collection engine
- Flexible workflow status management system
- Event-driven plugin architecture with priority ordering
- Search query system for dashboards and ETL pipelines
- Modern PostgreSQL-based storage with JSONB and vector capabilities
- AI-powered form design assistance
- AI plugin development and orchestration
- AI-driven workflow automation and analysis
- Comprehensive documentation for agent-driven development

#### Out of Scope

- Migration tools from legacy versions (focus on clean rebuild)
- Direct user interface (framework provides APIs, UIs built separately)
- Specific industry verticals (maintain general-purpose flexibility)
- Real-time collaboration features (focus on workflow automation)
- Multi-tenancy architecture (single-tenant focused initially)

### Stakeholders

| Role | Responsibilities | Representative(s) |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Product Owner | Project vision, requirements definition, priority setting | Project Initiator |
| LLM Development Agents | Code implementation, testing, documentation | Claude/AI agents |
| Architecture Lead | System design, technology decisions, technical standards | Project Initiator + AI collaboration |

### Timeline

| Milestone | Target Date | Description |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Architecture Definition | Phase 1 | Complete technical architecture, data models, and plugin framework design |
| Context Network Completion | Phase 1 | Full documentation and task breakdown for agent-driven development |
| Core Engine MVP | Phase 2 | Basic form definitions, data storage, and simple workflows |
| Plugin System | Phase 3 | Event pipeline, plugin architecture, and priority system |
| AI Integration | Phase 4 | LLM-powered features for form design and workflow automation |

### Budget and Resources

- **Development Resources**: Primarily LLM agents working from comprehensive task definitions
- **Infrastructure**: Modern cloud-native deployment targeting PostgreSQL and containerized services
- **Learning Investment**: Time spent understanding legacy system lessons and modern technology capabilities

### Constraints

- **Legacy Compatibility**: No requirement to maintain backward compatibility (clean rebuild approach)
- **Development Approach**: All implementation must be done by LLM agents working from detailed specifications
- **Technology Stack**: Must leverage modern PostgreSQL capabilities, TypeScript ecosystem, and AI integration
- **Documentation Dependency**: Progress gated on comprehensive context network and task definition quality

### Assumptions

- **LLM Agent Capability**: Current and near-future LLM agents can effectively implement complex software features given sufficient context
- **PostgreSQL Evolution**: Modern PostgreSQL with JSONB, vector search, and plugins can replace the legacy EAV + MongoDB hybrid
- **AI Integration Value**: LLM integration will provide significant value beyond traditional workflow automation
- **Context Network Effectiveness**: Comprehensive documentation will enable successful agent-driven development

### Risks

- **Complexity Underestimation**: The flexible plugin and form definition system may be more complex to implement than anticipated
- **AI Integration Challenges**: LLM capabilities may not meet expectations for form design and workflow automation
- **Agent Development Limitations**: LLM agents may struggle with certain aspects of implementation despite good documentation
- **Technology Stack Maturity**: Chosen modern technologies may not fully address all legacy system capabilities
