# Testing Documentation Index

## Purpose
This directory contains comprehensive testing strategy and implementation documentation for the Pliers v3 platform, providing guidance for all testing activities including unit, integration, and performance testing.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Supporting Element
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Overview

The testing documentation provides complete guidance for implementing, maintaining, and executing tests across the Pliers v3 platform. It establishes standards, patterns, and automation frameworks to ensure consistent code quality and system reliability.

## Documentation Structure

### Core Testing Strategy
- **[unit-testing-strategy.md](./unit-testing-strategy.md)** - Main testing strategy document defining framework selection, coverage requirements, and organizational patterns
- **[standards.md](./standards.md)** - Coding standards and conventions for test code quality and consistency
- **[patterns.md](./patterns.md)** - Common testing patterns and real-world examples for various scenarios

### Specialized Documentation
- **[llm-instructions.md](./llm-instructions.md)** - Specific instructions and templates for LLM agents writing tests
- **[ci-integration.md](./ci-integration.md)** - CI/CD pipeline configuration and automated testing workflows

## Quick Reference

### Framework Selection
- **Primary Framework**: Vitest v1.x (native ESM support, fast execution)
- **Component Testing**: Testing Library (behavior-focused testing)
- **Coverage Tool**: V8 (built into Vitest)
- **Mock Strategy**: Vitest mocks with custom factory patterns

### Coverage Requirements
- **Overall Minimum**: 80% across all metrics
- **Critical Components**: 90% (EventEngine, FormEngine, SubmissionEngine)
- **New Code**: 85% minimum for all new features
- **Error Handling**: 100% coverage of catch blocks

### Key Patterns
- **Test Structure**: Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- **Organization**: Feature-based grouping with describe blocks
- **Naming**: Behavior-focused test descriptions
- **Data Management**: Factory pattern with realistic test data
- **Mocking**: Comprehensive mocks using MockFactory utilities

### Test Types Distribution
- **Happy Path Tests**: 60% of test cases
- **Error Handling Tests**: 30% of test cases
- **Integration Tests**: 10% of test cases

### CI/CD Integration
- **Parallel Execution**: Optimized for multi-threaded test execution
- **Quality Gates**: Coverage and performance thresholds enforced
- **Automated Reporting**: Test results, coverage, and performance metrics
- **Branch Protection**: Required test passage for pull request merging

## Getting Started

### For New Developers
1. Start with [unit-testing-strategy.md](./unit-testing-strategy.md) for overall approach
2. Review [standards.md](./standards.md) for coding conventions
3. Study [patterns.md](./patterns.md) for practical examples
4. Reference [ci-integration.md](./ci-integration.md) for pipeline setup

### For LLM Agents
1. Follow [llm-instructions.md](./llm-instructions.md) for test generation guidelines
2. Use provided templates and validation rules
3. Ensure compliance with standards and patterns
4. Verify CI compatibility requirements

### For DevOps Engineers
1. Implement configurations from [ci-integration.md](./ci-integration.md)
2. Set up quality gates and performance monitoring
3. Configure branch protection rules
4. Establish test result reporting and alerting

## Common Tasks

### Writing Unit Tests
```bash
# Create test file following naming convention
touch src/components/MyComponent/MyComponent.test.ts

# Use patterns from documentation
# Follow AAA structure
# Implement comprehensive coverage
```

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode (development)
npm run test:watch

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration
```

### Checking Coverage
```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Check coverage thresholds
npm run test:coverage:check

# View coverage in browser
npm run test:coverage:ui
```

### Performance Testing
```bash
# Run performance tests
npm run test:performance

# Check performance thresholds
npm run test:performance:check
```

## Quality Assurance

### Before Committing
- [ ] All tests pass locally
- [ ] Coverage thresholds are met
- [ ] No linting or formatting errors
- [ ] Performance tests within limits

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] Tests follow established patterns
- [ ] Coverage includes error paths
- [ ] Mock usage is appropriate
- [ ] Test descriptions are clear and behavior-focused
- [ ] No hardcoded values or test pollution

### CI Pipeline Verification
- [ ] All test suites pass in CI
- [ ] Coverage reports are generated
- [ ] Performance baselines are maintained
- [ ] Quality gates are enforced

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Flaky Tests**: Review test isolation and async handling
- **Low Coverage**: Check for missing error path tests
- **Slow Tests**: Optimize mock usage and parallel execution
- **CI Failures**: Verify environment configuration and timeouts

### Performance Issues
- **Memory Leaks**: Use proper cleanup in afterEach hooks
- **Slow Execution**: Optimize mock setup and data factories
- **Timeout Failures**: Adjust CI-specific timeout values

## Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- Review and update performance baselines monthly
- Update dependency versions and test configurations quarterly
- Revise patterns and standards based on lessons learned
- Monitor and optimize CI pipeline performance

### Documentation Updates
- Update when new patterns are established
- Revise when testing requirements change
- Add examples for new component types
- Maintain CI configuration documentation
