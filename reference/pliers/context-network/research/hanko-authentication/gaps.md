### Conflicting Information

1. **Token Refresh Strategy**
   - Viewpoint A: Hanko uses cookie-based sessions
   - Viewpoint B: JWT refresh possible via API
   - Unable to resolve because: Documentation unclear
   - Impact on implementation: Affects token lifecycle management

2. **Social Login Integration**
   - Viewpoint A: OAuth providers supported
   - Viewpoint B: Limited to specific providers
   - Unable to resolve because: Provider list not comprehensive
   - Impact on implementation: May limit SSO options

3. **Password Migration Path**
   - Viewpoint A: Passwords can be imported
   - Viewpoint B: Users must reset passwords
   - Unable to resolve because: Security implications unclear
   - Impact on implementation: Affects user migration strategy

### Emerging Areas

**Passkey Backup and Recovery:**
- Why it seems significant: User lockout prevention
- Early indicators: Platform-specific solutions emerging
- Research needed: Cross-platform passkey portability

**Passwordless B2B Patterns:**

### Network Latency Effects

**Unknown:** JWKS endpoint latency from different regions
**Concern:** Global user experience
**Test needed:** Multi-region latency measurements

### Cache Invalidation Strategy

**Unknown:** How quickly revoked tokens propagate
**Concern:** Security window for compromised tokens
**Test needed:** Token revocation timing analysis

### Webhook Reliability

**Unknown:** Webhook delivery guarantees
**Concern:** User synchronization consistency
**Test needed:** Webhook failure and retry behavior

## Implementation Risks

### Risk: Vendor Lock-in

**Uncertainty:** Migration path if moving away from Hanko
**Impact:** Long-term flexibility
**Research needed:** Data export capabilities, API compatibility

### Risk: Browser Support Matrix

**Uncertainty:** Older browser compatibility
**Impact:** User accessibility
**Research needed:** Detailed browser support documentation

### Risk: Passkey Adoption Resistance

**Uncertainty:** User acceptance rate
**Impact:** ROI of implementation
**Research needed:** Industry adoption benchmarks
