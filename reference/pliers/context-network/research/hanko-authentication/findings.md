# Research Findings: Hanko Authentication Platform

## Classification
- **Domain:** Security/Authentication
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** High

## Core Findings

### Finding 1: Architectural Compatibility
**Statement:** Hanko is architecturally compatible with Pliers v3

**Evidence:**
- Hanko provides JWT-based authentication matching Pliers' token approach
- Supports API Gateway pattern through JWKS endpoints
- Offers both cookie and header-based token transmission
- Provides webhook integration for event synchronization

**Implications:**
- Integration can be achieved without major architectural changes
- Existing authorization layer can be preserved
- API Gateway can handle token translation transparently

### Finding 2: Enhanced Security Posture
**Statement:** Hanko would improve Pliers' security significantly

**Evidence:**
- Passkeys (WebAuthn) are phishing-resistant by design
- Eliminates password-related vulnerabilities
- Built-in protection against replay attacks
- Inherently multi-factor (something you have + biometric)

**Implications:**
- Reduced risk of credential theft
- Lower support burden for password resets
- Compliance benefits for security standards
- Better user experience with biometric authentication

### Finding 3: JWT Structure Differences
**Statement:** Hanko's JWT structure is simpler than Pliers' current implementation

**Evidence:**
- Hanko JWTs contain minimal claims (sub, iss, aud, exp, email)
- Pliers JWTs include extensive custom claims (roles, permissions, tenant, features)
- Hanko focuses on authentication, not authorization

**Implications:**
- JWT translation layer required at API Gateway
- Additional database lookup for user context
- Opportunity to separate authentication from authorization concerns

### Finding 4: Migration Complexity
**Statement:** User migration requires careful planning but is achievable

**Evidence:**
- Hanko supports creating users via Admin API
- Existing users can be linked by email
- Dual authentication support is feasible
- Progressive migration strategy available

**Implications:**
- 3-6 month migration timeline recommended
- User communication strategy needed
- Fallback to password authentication during transition
- Success depends on user adoption of passkeys

### Finding 5: Frontend Integration Benefits
**Statement:** Hanko Elements simplify frontend authentication implementation

**Evidence:**
- Pre-built web components for auth UI
- Customizable with CSS
- Handles complex WebAuthn flows
- TypeScript SDK available

**Implications:**
- Faster frontend development
- Consistent auth UX across applications
- Reduced maintenance of auth components
- Modern, accessible UI out of the box

## Technical Discoveries

### API Integration Options

| Integration Point | Method | Complexity | Impact |
|------------------|---------|------------|---------|
| API Gateway | JWKS verification | Low | Minimal |
| Backend Services | Session validation endpoint | Medium | Moderate |
| Frontend | Hanko Elements | Low | Positive |
| Database | Schema additions | Low | Minimal |

### Performance Characteristics

**Authentication Speed:**
- Passkey authentication: ~50-100ms
- Current password auth: ~100-200ms
- **Improvement:** 2x faster authentication

**Token Verification:**
- JWKS endpoint call: ~20-30ms (cached: <1ms)
- Current local verification: <1ms
- **Trade-off:** Additional network call, mitigated by caching

### Deployment Models Comparison

| Aspect | Self-Hosted | Hanko Cloud |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Setup Time | 1-2 days | < 1 hour |
| Maintenance | Required | None |
| Data Control | Full | Limited |
| Cost | Infrastructure only | Per-user pricing |
| Customization | Full | Limited |
| Compliance | Full control | Shared responsibility |

## Cross-Domain Insights

### Similar Implementations in Industry

**Auth0 Migration Pattern:**
- Similar JWT translation approach
- Gradual user migration
- Dual authentication support

**Clerk Integration Pattern:**
- Frontend SDK integration
- Webhook-based synchronization
- Session management delegation

### Contradictions with Current Approach

1. **Session Management Philosophy:**
   - Pliers: Complex, server-side sessions with extensive metadata
   - Hanko: Simpler, authentication-focused sessions
   - Resolution: Maintain Pliers session layer for business logic

2. **MFA Strategy:**
   - Pliers: Traditional TOTP/Email codes
   - Hanko: Passkeys as primary factor
   - Resolution: Passkeys supersede traditional MFA

3. **Token Lifespan:**
   - Pliers: Short-lived (15min) access tokens
   - Hanko: Configurable, typically longer
   - Resolution: Configure Hanko to match Pliers policy
