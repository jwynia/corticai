## Recommendations for Future Research

### Priority Areas for Additional Investigation:
1. **Independent Security Audits** of major passkey implementations
2. **Large-scale User Studies** on authentication method preferences
3. **Enterprise Migration Case Studies** with detailed implementation experiences
4. **Quantitative Security Metrics** comparing authentication methods
5. **Regulatory Compliance Analysis** across different jurisdictions

### Improved Source Diversity Needs:
- More academic/independent research
- Non-Western perspectives on authentication
- Small business implementation experiences
- Accessibility-focused analysis
- Long-term maintenance and support considerations
