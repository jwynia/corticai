## Classification
- **Domain:** AI/Forms/UX
- **Stability:** Experimental
- **Abstraction:** Specification
- **Confidence:** Speculative

## Overview

The AI Form Complexity Advisor acts as an intelligent guardian of form quality, preventing the creation of monolithic forms that violate Pliers' decomposition principles. It provides real-time analysis, proactive suggestions, and guided refactoring assistance.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Complexity Analysis

```typescript
interface ComplexityAnalyzer {
  // Real-time complexity scoring
  analyzeComplexity(form: FormDefinition): ComplexityScore;

  // Detailed breakdown of complexity factors
  getComplexityFactors(form: FormDefinition): ComplexityFactors;

  // Trend analysis over time
  trackComplexityTrend(formId: string): ComplexityTrend;
}

interface ComplexityScore {
  score: number; // 0-100
  level: 'simple' | 'moderate' | 'complex' | 'critical';
  threshold: number; // Recommended max (default: 20)
  factors: {
    fieldCount: number;
    nestingDepth: number;
    conditionalComplexity: number;
    validationComplexity: number;
    relationshipCount: number;
  };
}
```

### 2. Cohesion Detection

The AI identifies logical groupings of fields that could become separate forms.

```typescript
interface CohesionDetector {
  detectGroups(fields: Field[]): FieldGroup[];
  analyzeRelationships(groups: FieldGroup[]): GroupRelationship[];
  suggestFormBoundaries(groups: FieldGroup[]): FormBoundary[];
}

interface FieldGroup {
  name: string;
  fields: Field[];
  cohesionScore: number; // How related the fields are
  suggestedFormName: string;
  rationale: string; // Why these belong together
}

// Example detection patterns:
const patterns = {
  prefixGrouping: 'billing_*', // Fields with common prefix
  typeGrouping: 'all date fields', // Similar field types
  validationGrouping: 'required fields', // Similar validation
  semanticGrouping: 'address fields' // Domain knowledge
};
```

### 3. Decomposition Suggestions

```typescript
interface DecompositionAdvisor {
  suggestDecomposition(form: FormDefinition): DecompositionPlan;
  estimateImpact(plan: DecompositionPlan): ImpactAnalysis;
  generateMigrationSteps(plan: DecompositionPlan): MigrationGuide;
}

interface DecompositionPlan {
  mainForm: {
    name: string;
    fields: Field[];
    description: string;
  };
  relatedForms: Array<{
    name: string;
    fields: Field[];
    relationshipType: 'child' | 'sibling' | 'reference';
    cardinality: 'one-to-one' | 'one-to-many' | 'many-to-many';
  }>;
  dashboards: Array<{
    name: string;
    purpose: string;
    queries: QueryDefinition[];
  }>;
}
```

## Interaction Patterns

### 1. Proactive Monitoring

```typescript
const ProactiveAdvisor = {
  // Triggered on field addition
  onFieldAdded: (form, newField) => {
    const complexity = analyzer.analyzeComplexity(form);
    if (complexity.score > 70) {
      return {
        level: 'warning',
        message: `Adding "${newField.name}" increases complexity to ${complexity.score}`,
        suggestion: 'Consider creating a related form instead',
        actions: ['Continue anyway', 'View suggestions', 'Undo']
      };
    }
  },

  // Periodic analysis
  onSave: (form) => {
    const groups = detector.detectGroups(form.fields);
    if (groups.length > 3) {
      return {
        level: 'info',
        message: 'This form could be split into multiple focused forms',
        suggestion: `Detected ${groups.length} logical groups`,
        actions: ['Review suggestions', 'Dismiss']
      };
    }
  }
};
```

### 2. Interactive Refactoring

```typescript
interface RefactoringWizard {
  // Step-by-step guidance
  steps: [
    'Review detected groups',
    'Adjust groupings',
    'Define relationships',
    'Preview result',
    'Apply changes'
  ];

  // User can modify AI suggestions
  allowUserAdjustments: true;

  // Preview before committing
  previewMode: true;

  // Rollback capability
  canUndo: true;
}
```

### 3. Natural Language Interface

```typescript
interface NLInterface {
  // User describes intent
  parseIntent(input: string): Intent;

  // AI responds with plan
  generatePlan(intent: Intent): DecompositionPlan;

  // Conversational refinement
  refine(plan: DecompositionPlan, feedback: string): DecompositionPlan;
}

// Example interactions:
const examples = [
  {
    user: "This form is getting too big",
    ai: "I see 35 fields. I can group them into 3 related forms: Basic Info (12 fields), Billing (10 fields), and Preferences (13 fields). Would you like to see the breakdown?"
  },
  {
    user: "Split out the address fields",
    ai: "I'll create a separate 'Address' form with the 7 address-related fields. This will be a child relationship with the main form. Shall I proceed?"
  },
  {
    user: "Show me what's making this complex",
    ai: "The main complexity factors are: 42 fields (2x recommended), 5 levels of nesting, and 12 conditional rules. The billing and shipping sections could be separate forms."
  }
];
```

## AI Models and Techniques

### 1. Pattern Recognition
```typescript
interface PatternRecognizer {
  // Learn from existing form decompositions
  trainOnExistingForms(forms: FormDefinition[]): Model;

  // Identify common patterns
  recognizePatterns(form: FormDefinition): Pattern[];

  // Apply learned patterns
  applyPattern(pattern: Pattern, form: FormDefinition): DecompositionPlan;
}
```

### 2. Semantic Analysis
```typescript
interface SemanticAnalyzer {
  // Understand field relationships through naming
  analyzeFieldNames(fields: Field[]): SemanticGroups;

  // Use domain knowledge
  applyDomainKnowledge(domain: string, fields: Field[]): DomainGroups;

  // Detect business entities
  identifyEntities(fields: Field[]): BusinessEntity[];
}
```

### 3. Machine Learning Integration
```typescript
interface MLIntegration {
  // Feature extraction
  extractFeatures(form: FormDefinition): FeatureVector;

  // Complexity prediction
  predictComplexity(features: FeatureVector): number;

  // Decomposition classification
  classifyDecomposition(features: FeatureVector): DecompositionType;

  // User preference learning
  learnUserPreferences(history: RefactoringHistory[]): UserModel;
}
```

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Integration Points

```typescript
const IntegrationPoints = {
  formBuilder: {
    hooks: ['onFieldAdd', 'onFieldRemove', 'onFieldUpdate', 'onSave'],
    ui: ['sidebar', 'toolbar', 'modal', 'inline-hints']
  },

  runtime: {
    monitoring: 'Track form usage and pain points',
    analytics: 'Measure decomposition success',
    feedback: 'Collect user satisfaction'
  },

  backend: {
    storage: 'Store decomposition history',
    training: 'Improve ML models',
    sharing: 'Share patterns across teams'
  }
};
```

### 2. User Experience

```typescript
interface UXPrinciples {
  nonIntrusive: 'Suggestions, not interruptions';
  educational: 'Explain why, not just what';
  flexible: 'User can override any suggestion';
  progressive: 'Start simple, reveal complexity';
  contextual: 'Aware of user expertise level';
}
```

### 3. Privacy and Ethics

```typescript
interface PrivacyConsiderations {
  dataHandling: {
    localProcessing: 'Prefer client-side analysis';
    anonymization: 'Remove PII before processing';
    optIn: 'User controls AI features';
  };

  transparency: {
    explainability: 'Show reasoning for suggestions';
    confidence: 'Display confidence levels';
    limitations: 'Clear about what AI cannot do';
  };
}
```

## Example Interactions

### Scenario 1: Form Growing Too Large
```typescript
// User adds 21st field
AI: "This form now has 21 fields. Consider splitting into related forms."
Options: [
  "Show me how",
  "I'll keep it as is",
  "Remind me later"
]

// User selects "Show me how"
AI: "I've identified 3 logical groups:
  1. Customer Info (8 fields)
  2. Order Details (7 fields)
  3. Shipping Info (6 fields)

  Would you like to create separate forms for these?"
```

### Scenario 2: Proactive Pattern Detection
```typescript
AI: "I notice you're creating fields similar to the 'Customer' form.
     Would you like to reuse that form as a relationship instead?"

Options: [
  "Yes, add relationship",
  "No, these are different",
  "Show me the similarities"
]
```

### Scenario 3: Natural Language Refactoring
```typescript
User: "This form is a mess, help me organize it"

AI: "I can see why - there are 5 different concepts mixed together.
     Here's my suggested organization:

     Main Form: 'Project' (core fields only)
     └── Tasks (one-to-many child)
     └── Budget (one-to-one child)
     └── Team Members (many-to-many reference)
     └── Timeline (one-to-one child)

     This would reduce the main form to 8 fields.
     Shall I create this structure for you?"
```
