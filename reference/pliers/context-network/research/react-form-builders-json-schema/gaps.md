# Open Questions: React Form Builders Research

## Classification
- **Domain:** Research/Meta
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Conceptual
- **Confidence:** Speculative

## v3 Architecture Considerations

### Moving from v2 to v3

1. **Data Loading Strategy**
   - v2: All data loaded upfront
   - v3: Lazy loading requirements
   - Questions: How to maintain client-side query capabilities with lazy loading?
   - Impact: Need hybrid approach - eager load for active collections, lazy for others

2. **Collection Management at Scale**
   - Challenge: Managing dozens of open tabs with related collections
   - v3 Goal: Optimize memory usage while maintaining performance
   - Suggested approach: Virtual scrolling + data pagination + smart caching

3. **Semantic Navigation Enhancement**
   - Current: Relationship-based navigation works well
   - v3 Opportunity: Add breadcrumb context without breaking semantic model
   - Consider: Navigation history per tab vs global history

   - What we found: General WCAG compliance claims
   - What's missing: Detailed accessibility audit results, screen reader testing
   - Suggested research: Comprehensive accessibility testing suite

### Conflicting Information

1. **Bundle Size Impact**
   - Viewpoint A: RJSF ~200KB is acceptable for features provided
   - Viewpoint B: Any library >100KB is too heavy for modern apps
   - Unable to resolve because: Depends on specific use case and constraints
   - Impact on implementation: May need conditional loading strategies

2. **Schema Approach Philosophy**
   - Viewpoint A: Single schema (RJSF) is simpler and sufficient
   - Viewpoint B: Dual schema (JSON Forms) provides necessary control
   - Unable to resolve because: Both have valid use cases
   - Impact on implementation: Architecture decision affects entire system

3. **Visual Builder Necessity**
   - Viewpoint A: Essential for adoption by non-technical users
   - Viewpoint B: Adds complexity without proportional value
   - Unable to resolve because: Depends on target user base
   - Impact on implementation: Major resource allocation decision

4. **Performance Optimization Strategies**
   - Viewpoint A: Virtual scrolling is the solution
   - Viewpoint B: Pagination provides better UX
   - Viewpoint C: Progressive loading balances both
   - Unable to resolve because: Lack of comparative testing
   - Impact on implementation: Core architecture consideration

### Emerging Areas
