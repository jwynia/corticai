# Research Findings: React Form Builders with JSON Schema Support

## Classification
- **Domain:** Frontend/React/Form Management
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** High (varies by finding)

## Structured Findings

### Pliers Form Architecture Philosophy

#### Form Decomposition Pattern
- **Definition:** Breaking large forms into focused parent/child relationships instead of monolithic structures
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Large forms (>20 fields) are considered anti-patterns
  - Each form represents a cohesive, bounded context
  - Related data surfaced through mini-dashboards
  - Collections grouped by type and displayed alongside main form
- **Benefits:**
  - Better performance (smaller individual forms)
  - Clearer domain boundaries
  - Easier maintenance and testing
  - More intuitive user experience
- **Source Consensus:** Aligns with domain-driven design principles

#### Form Ecosystem vs Single Forms
- **Definition:** System of interconnected forms with relationships rather than standalone forms
- **Components:**
  - Main form (primary entity)
  - Related form collections (children/associations)
  - Mini-dashboards (query-based views)
  - Action-based relationship management
- **Navigation:**
  - Semantic navigation based on relationships
  - Multi-tab workflows (users often have dozens of tabs)
  - Not temporal/browser-history based
- **v3 Considerations:**
  - Moving from all-data-loaded to lazy loading
  - Maintaining semantic navigation patterns
  - Optimizing collection queries

### Core Concepts

#### JSON Schema Form Generation
- **Definition:** Creating dynamic forms from JSON Schema definitions that describe data structure and validation rules
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - Declarative form definition
  - Automatic UI generation from schema
  - Built-in validation based on schema constraints
  - Support for complex nested structures
- **Variations/Schools of Thought:**
  - Single schema approach (RJSF): One JSON Schema defines both data and basic UI
  - Dual schema approach (JSON Forms): Separate data schema and UI schema
  - Hybrid approaches: Schema plus configuration objects
- **Source Consensus:** Strong agreement on benefits of schema-driven forms

#### Visual Form Builders
- **Definition:** Drag-and-drop interfaces that generate JSON Schema or form configurations
- **Key Characteristics:**
  - WYSIWYG editing experience
  - Real-time preview capabilities
  - Export to JSON Schema format
  - Component palette with field types
- **Implementations:**
  - react-json-schema-form-builder (Ginkgo Bioworks)
  - SurveyJS Form Builder
  - Form.io Builder
  - Coltorapps Builder
- **Source Consensus:** Visual builders increasingly important for non-technical users

## Technical Implementation Patterns

### Schema Generation from TypeScript
```typescript
// Using ts-json-schema-generator
import { createGenerator } from 'ts-json-schema-generator';

const generator = createGenerator({
  path: 'src/types/*.ts',
  tsconfig: 'tsconfig.json',
});

const schema = generator.createSchema('MyFormType');
```

### OpenAPI to Form Schema
```typescript
// Transform OpenAPI schema to JSON Schema
function openAPIToJSONSchema(openAPISchema) {
  // Remove OpenAPI-specific properties
  const { nullable, example, ...jsonSchema } = openAPISchema;
  
  // Handle nullable as JSON Schema type array
  if (nullable) {
    jsonSchema.type = [jsonSchema.type, 'null'];
  }
  
  return jsonSchema;
}
```

### Performance Optimization Strategies
```typescript
// Memoized schema compilation
const compiledSchemas = new Map();

function getCompiledSchema(schema) {
  const key = JSON.stringify(schema);
  if (!compiledSchemas.has(key)) {
    compiledSchemas.set(key, compileSchema(schema));
  }
  return compiledSchemas.get(key);
}

// Virtual scrolling for large forms
const VirtualForm = ({ schema, formData }) => {
  const fields = useMemo(() => getFields(schema), [schema]);
  
  return (
    <VirtualList
      items={fields}
      renderItem={(field) => <FormField field={field} />}
    />
  );
};
```

## Modal and Navigation Patterns

### Modal Usage Guidelines
- **Modals FOR:** Read-only display with navigation links
- **NOT FOR:** Inline editing (causes state management issues)
- **Full Views FOR:** Actual editing operations
- **Benefits:** Avoids nested form state complexity, clearer user mental model

### Semantic Navigation
- **Principle:** Navigation based on data relationships, not browser history
- **Implementation:** Parent/child links available based on semantic relationships
- **User Pattern:** Multiple tabs open to different entities (orders, tasks, etc.)
- **Advantage:** Supports complex workflows without losing context

## Integration with Pliers Form Engine

### Revised Architecture Focus
Given the form decomposition pattern, integration priorities shift from large form optimization to:

1. **Collection Management**
   - Rendering groups of related forms
   - Client-side querying of loaded collections
   - Efficient updates when collections change

2. **Relationship Components**
   - Action-based relationship management ("Add task" not "Create relationship")
   - Visual grouping of related entities
   - Navigation between related forms

3. **Mini-Dashboard Integration**
   - Query builders for collection filtering
   - Summary statistics components
   - Status aggregations (e.g., "all blocked tasks")

4. **AI Complexity Monitoring**
   - Form complexity analysis
   - Decomposition suggestions when threshold exceeded
   - Guided refactoring workflows

### Alignment Opportunities
- Pliers' JSONB storage aligns well with JSON Schema approach
- Form Engine's field type system maps to JSON Schema types
- Conditional logic engine compatible with JSON Schema if/then/else
- Event system can integrate with form lifecycle hooks

### Recommended Integration Strategy
1. Use RJSF as the React rendering layer
2. Transform Pliers Form Definitions to JSON Schema
3. Implement custom widgets for Pliers-specific field types
4. Bridge validation between Zod and JSON Schema
5. Maintain bidirectional sync between formats

### Potential Challenges
- Schema version differences (Pliers custom vs JSON Schema standard)
- Performance with complex conditional logic
- Maintaining type safety across transformations
- Custom field type compatibility
