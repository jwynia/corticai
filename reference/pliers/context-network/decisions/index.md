## Key Architectural Decisions Summary

### Technology Stack Core Decisions
1. **PostgreSQL with JSONB** - Chosen over EAV model for performance and simplicity
2. **TypeScript + Zod** - Selected for type safety and runtime validation
3. **Event Sourcing** - Implemented for audit trail and plugin processing
4. **GraphQL API** - Chosen for type safety and real-time capabilities

### AI Integration Core Decisions
1. **Multi-Provider Strategy** - Support multiple LLM providers for flexibility
2. **Vector Search Integration** - PostgreSQL vector extensions for semantic search
3. **Context-Aware AI** - Rich context building for better AI responses
4. **Cost-Optimized AI Usage** - Intelligent caching and model selection

### Development Process Core Decisions
1. **Agent-First Development** - All implementation by LLM agents
2. **Context Network Approach** - Comprehensive documentation for agent understanding
3. **Incremental Implementation** - Phased approach with early validation
4. **Quality-First Process** - Strict quality standards for agent work

## Decision Tracking and Updates

### When to Create Decision Records
- Technology or framework selections
- Architectural pattern choices
- Process or methodology decisions
- Security or compliance approaches
- Any decision with long-term implications

### Decision Review Process
- **Quarterly Reviews** - Assess decision outcomes and validity
- **Impact Assessment** - Evaluate consequences of each decision
- **Course Correction** - Update or supersede decisions when needed
- **Lessons Learned** - Document insights from decision outcomes
