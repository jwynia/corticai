# Decision: Hono Framework for API Services

## Status
Accepted

## Date
2025-09-20

## Context

The Pliers v3 architecture requires a high-performance, lightweight web framework for building both the Core API service and the AI service. The framework needs to support:

1. **Performance Requirements** - High throughput for form submissions and API calls
2. **TypeScript First** - Strong typing throughout the application
3. **Modern Standards** - Web standards APIs and edge computing compatibility
4. **Developer Experience** - Good ergonomics for LLM agent development
5. **Flexibility** - Support for both REST and WebSocket protocols
6. **Lightweight** - Minimal overhead and dependencies

Traditional Node.js frameworks like Express have served well but are showing their age. Newer frameworks promise better performance and developer experience.

## Decision

**Selected Framework: Hono**

Hono will be used as the web framework for both the Core API service and the AI service (via Mastra.ai integration).

## Rationale

### Factors Considered
- **Performance** - Benchmarks show 2-3x performance improvement over Express
- **Size** - Ultra-lightweight with minimal dependencies (under 20KB)
- **Type Safety** - Built with TypeScript from the ground up
- **Standards** - Web Standards API compatibility (Request/Response objects)
- **Edge Ready** - Can deploy to Cloudflare Workers, Deno, Bun, or Node.js
- **Developer Experience** - Clean, intuitive API that LLM agents understand well
- **Ecosystem** - Growing ecosystem with good middleware support

### Alternatives Considered

#### 1. **Express.js**
- **Pros:**
  - Most mature and battle-tested
  - Huge ecosystem of middleware
  - Extensive LLM training data availability
  - Well-understood patterns
- **Cons:**
  - Performance limitations (callback-based)
  - Not TypeScript native (types added later)
  - Aging architecture
  - Larger bundle size
- **Why rejected:** Performance concerns and lack of modern features

#### 2. **Fastify**
- **Pros:**
  - Excellent performance (better than Express)
  - Good TypeScript support
  - Schema-based validation
  - Plugin architecture
- **Cons:**
  - More complex than needed
  - Heavier than Hono
  - Less edge-compatible
  - Steeper learning curve
- **Why rejected:** Complexity overhead without proportional benefits

#### 3. **Elysia (Bun)**
- **Pros:**
  - Exceptional performance with Bun runtime
  - Excellent TypeScript integration
  - Modern API design
  - End-to-end type safety
- **Cons:**
  - Requires Bun runtime (not Node.js)
  - Smaller ecosystem
  - Less mature
  - Limited LLM agent familiarity
- **Why rejected:** Bun dependency adds complexity and limits deployment options

#### 4. **tRPC**
- **Pros:**
  - Perfect TypeScript integration
  - End-to-end type safety
  - No code generation needed
  - Great developer experience
- **Cons:**
  - Not a general web framework
  - Tight coupling between client and server
  - Less flexible for REST APIs
  - Harder to integrate with non-TypeScript clients
- **Why rejected:** Too opinionated for a flexible API service

### Decision Criteria

#### **Performance** (Weight: 30%)
- **Hono:** Exceptional performance, optimized for modern JavaScript runtimes
- **Evaluation:** Meets high-throughput requirements for form processing

#### **TypeScript Support** (Weight: 25%)
- **Hono:** First-class TypeScript support with excellent type inference
- **Evaluation:** Provides type safety without boilerplate

#### **Developer Experience** (Weight: 20%)
- **Hono:** Clean, intuitive API that's easy for LLM agents to work with
- **Evaluation:** Reduces complexity and improves development velocity

#### **Deployment Flexibility** (Weight: 15%)
- **Hono:** Works on Node.js, Deno, Bun, and edge runtimes
- **Evaluation:** Future-proofs deployment options

#### **Bundle Size** (Weight: 10%)
- **Hono:** Ultra-lightweight, minimal dependencies
- **Evaluation:** Reduces deployment size and cold start times

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Performance Gains:** 2-3x improvement in request handling over Express
- **Type Safety:** Built-in TypeScript support improves code quality
- **Modern Standards:** Web Standards APIs prepare for future platforms
- **Edge Compatibility:** Can deploy to CDN edge locations if needed
- **Clean Architecture:** Minimal, focused API reduces complexity
- **Fast Development:** Simple patterns accelerate feature development
- **Future Proof:** Compatible with emerging JavaScript runtimes

### Negative
- **Smaller Ecosystem:** Fewer middleware options than Express
  - *Mitigation:* Most middleware can be easily ported or replaced
- **Less Documentation:** Newer framework with less extensive docs
  - *Mitigation:* Core API is simple and well-documented, examples growing
- **LLM Training Data:** Less representation in LLM training sets
  - *Mitigation:* API similarity to Express helps, provide examples in context

### Risks
- **Framework Maturity:** Hono is newer and less battle-tested
  - *Mitigation:* Active development, growing adoption, simple codebase to debug
- **Ecosystem Growth:** Middleware ecosystem still developing
  - *Mitigation:* Core functionality doesn't require extensive middleware
- **Breaking Changes:** Potential for API changes in future versions
  - *Mitigation:* Pin versions, review changelogs carefully

## Implementation

### Required Changes
- **API Service Setup:** Initialize Hono application with TypeScript
- **Routing Structure:** Implement RESTful routes using Hono patterns
- **Middleware Setup:** Configure CORS, authentication, logging middleware
- **Validation Integration:** Connect Zod schemas with Hono validation
- **OpenAPI Generation:** Setup automatic API documentation generation
- **WebSocket Support:** Implement real-time features using Hono WebSocket

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "hono": "^4.x",
    "@hono/node-server": "^1.x",
    "@hono/zod-validator": "^0.x",
    "@hono/swagger-ui": "^0.x"
  }
}
```

### Code Example
```typescript
// Example Hono API setup
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { cors } from 'hono/cors';
import { logger } from 'hono/logger';
import { zValidator } from '@hono/zod-validator';
import { FormDefinitionSchema } from '@pliers/shared';

const app = new Hono();

// Middleware
app.use('*', cors());
app.use('*', logger());

// Routes with Zod validation
app.post('/api/v1/forms',
  zValidator('json', FormDefinitionSchema),
  async (c) => {
    const formDef = c.req.valid('json');
    // Process form definition
    return c.json({ success: true, id: formDef.id });
  }
);

export default app;
```

## Review and Validation

### Success Criteria
- **Performance Benchmarks:** API response times < 50ms for typical requests
- **Type Safety:** Zero runtime type errors in production
- **Developer Velocity:** Feature implementation 2x faster than Express baseline
- **LLM Agent Success:** Agents can effectively work with Hono patterns
- **Deployment Success:** Successful deployment to multiple environments

### Review Schedule
- **1-Month Review:** Initial implementation assessment
- **3-Month Review:** Performance and developer experience evaluation
- **6-Month Review:** Ecosystem maturity and long-term viability assessment

### Validation Metrics
- Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Memory usage and CPU utilization
- Development velocity (features per sprint)
- Bug density related to framework issues
- Agent task completion rates
