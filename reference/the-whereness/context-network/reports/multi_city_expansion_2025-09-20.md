✅ Deep context processing initiated
✅ Intent classification complete
✅ Operational data collection in progress

### Files Generated
- 5 discovery files in `data/.discovery_results/denver/`
- Intent reports in `data/denver/context/intents/`
- Operational data in `data/denver/context/operational/`

## Technical Achievements

### Script Conversions Completed
✅ Converted all deep context scripts from Deno to Node/tsx
✅ Fixed top-level await issues
✅ Implemented proper async/await patterns
✅ Added necessary npm dependencies (glob, minimist)

### Files Fixed
- real_data_processor.ts
- service_disambiguator.ts
- operational_collector.ts
- use_case_mapper.ts
- reality_validator.ts
- llm_intent_analyzer.ts
- venue_researcher.ts
- All test files

## Recursive Expansion Pattern Demonstrated

The expansion follows the documented pattern:
```
Categories → Options → Understanding → Patterns → New Categories
```

1. **Categories Expanded**: Coffee, Breweries, Restaurants, Parks, Cultural, Outdoor, Cannabis
2. **Options Discovered**: 30 total venues across two cities
3. **Understanding Deepened**: Intent classification, operational data
4. **Patterns Emerging**: City-specific categories (Cannabis for Denver)
5. **New Categories Suggested**: Ready for next expansion round

## Next Steps

### Immediate
- [ ] Continue adding more venues to reach ~50 per city
- [ ] Process remaining categories through deep context
- [ ] Fix occasional LLM JSON parsing errors

### Short-term
- [ ] Expand to more neighborhoods
- [ ] Add service categories (auto, medical, etc.)
- [ ] Build relationship mappings between venues

### Long-term
- [ ] Automate discovery from Reddit/news sources
- [ ] Implement weekly synthesis cycles
- [ ] Generate static site from processed data

## Metrics
- **Venues Added**: 30 (16 Minneapolis + 14 Denver)
- **Categories Covered**: 7 unique categories
- **Files Processed**: 10 discovery files
- **Scripts Fixed**: 8+ TypeScript files
- **Processing Time**: ~2 hours total

## Conclusion
The recursive expansion framework is successfully operational across multiple cities. The system is now processing real venue data through the deep context pipeline, demonstrating the full workflow from discovery to intent analysis to operational understanding.
