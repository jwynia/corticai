# Architecture Patterns Index

## Purpose
This document indexes all architectural patterns for The Whereness System, including pipeline patterns, data flow patterns, and implementation patterns.

## Classification
- **Domain:** System Architecture
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Pattern Categories

### Organizational Patterns
- [Place Context Network](./place-network.md) - Graph-based organization of place information using index model
- [Hobby Ecosystem](./hobby-ecosystem.md) - Patterns for discovering and mapping hobby resources and communities
- [Relationship Types](./relationship-types.md) - Semantic relationship definitions between entities

### Research & Discovery Patterns
- [Research Depth Layers](./research-depth-layers.md) - Four-layer model for capturing surface to underground information
- [Discovery & Experience](./discovery-experience.md) - Experiential and sensory dimensions of place documentation

### Pipeline Patterns
*To be documented as extraction, synthesis, and evaluation patterns are established.*

### Data Flow Patterns
*To be documented as entity processing patterns are established.*

### Entity Structure Patterns
- [Place Network](./place-network.md) - Updated core entity definitions with chain classification and metro addresses
- See [ADR 004](../decisions/004-entity-structure-improvements.md) for chain classification and address schema decisions

### Metro Context Patterns
*To be documented as metro-specific implementation patterns emerge.*
