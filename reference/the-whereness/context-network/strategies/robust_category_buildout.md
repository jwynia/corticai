# Robust Category Buildout Strategy

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have (5 venues)
- **Craft cocktail bars**: Apothecary Lounge, Anodyne, Matanza Lounge, Casa Esencia, Vernon Club
- **Intent classification**: Speakeasy experience vs social drinking vs pool hall
- **Operational reality**: Payment methods, parking, timing, neighborhood context
- **Confidence levels**: 21% average (very low, as expected for initial build)

### What We've Learned
1. **Intent-based classification works**: Successfully distinguished different user needs within "cocktail bars"
2. **Local context matters**: Altitude effects, ma√±ana culture, neighborhood personalities
3. **Operational details critical**: Payment, parking, timing make the difference
4. **Discovery API issues**: Current system returns mock data, needs real data sources

## Category Expansion Strategy

### Phase 1: Fix Data Collection Foundation

#### 1A: Resolve Discovery API Issues
**Problem**: Mock data being returned instead of real search results
**Solutions to investigate**:
1. **MCP Session Setup**: Initialize MCP tools properly for server context
2. **Alternative APIs**: Direct SerpAPI, Google Places API, Yelp API integration
3. **Manual Curation**: Local research, Reddit mining, direct reconnaissance
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Combine automated discovery with manual validation

#### 1B: Alternative Data Sources (Immediate Implementation)
While fixing APIs, build robust manual data collection:

**Reddit Mining**:
- r/Albuquerque daily threads
- "Moving to ABQ" posts and responses
- Local recommendation threads
- Complaint/disappointment patterns

**Local Media Analysis**:
- Albuquerque Journal restaurant reviews
- DiscoverABQ event listings
- Alibi weekly entertainment guide
- Local blog mining

**Direct Reconnaissance**:
- Google Maps systematic browsing
- Yelp category deep-dives
- Local business directory mining
- On-ground verification of promising finds

### Phase 2: Systematic Category Expansion

#### Priority 1: Essential Daily Services (Beyond Food/Drink)

**Laundry & Cleaning Services**
- Self-service laundromats (safety, hours, cost per load)
- Wash-and-fold services (turnaround time, pricing, quality)
- Dry cleaners (specialty items, environmental practices, local reputation)
- Intent disambiguation: "Quick and cheap" vs "Specialty care" vs "Convenience"

**Auto Services & Transportation**
- Local mechanic recommendations (specialties, honest pricing, local trust)
- Gas stations with quality food/coffee (road trip essentials)
- Parking solutions (downtown workers, event attendees, tourists)
- Car rental alternatives (local vs national, unique needs)

**Health & Wellness Access**
- Walk-in clinics (wait times, insurance acceptance, quality reputation)
- Pharmacies (24-hour access, specialty services, local vs chain differences)
- Emergency dental/vision (visitor disasters, local recommendations)
- Mental health resources (sliding scale, accessibility, cultural competence)

#### Priority 2: Enhanced Food Categories (Intent-Based)

**Coffee & Work Spaces**
- **Remote Work Friendly**: WiFi reliability, power outlets, noise levels, table availability
- **Quick Caffeine Fix**: Drive-through options, speed, consistency
- **Coffee Quality Focus**: Third-wave, local roasters, brewing methods
- **Social Meeting Spots**: Conversation-friendly, comfortable seating, ambiance

**New Mexican Food (Authenticity Spectrum)**

- **Local Authentic**: Where locals actually eat, family recipes, hidden gems
- **Green Chile Intensity**: Heat levels, authenticity markers, variety
- **Special Dietary**: Vegetarian, gluten-free, modern takes on traditional

#### Priority 3: Activities & Experiences

**Movement & Fitness (By Intent)**
- **Stress Relief**: Yoga studios, meditation spaces, spa services

- **Seasonal Adaptation**: Weather changes, event preparation, pattern recognition
- **Community Connection**: Volunteering, civic participation, neighbor relationships

#### Special Circumstances
- **Accessibility Needs**: Physical, economic, cultural accessibility mapping
- **Crisis Support**: Emergency resources, transition assistance, recovery support
- **Cultural Bridging**: International communities, language support, cultural exchange

## Implementation Framework

### Data Collection Methodology

#### 1. Systematic Research Process
```typescript
interface CategoryBuildoutProcess {
  research_phase: {
    reddit_mining: string[];           // Relevant subreddit analysis
    media_analysis: string[];          // Local publication review
    directory_mining: string[];        // Business directory deep-dive
    competitor_analysis: string[];     // Other guide analysis
  };

  discovery_phase: {
    automated_search: string[];        // API-based discovery (when working)
    manual_curation: string[];         // Direct research findings
    local_validation: string[];        // Resident feedback/confirmation
    pattern_recognition: string[];     // Local quirks and patterns
  };

  validation_phase: {
    operational_verification: string[]; // Hours, policies, reality checks
    intent_classification: string[];   // User need matching
    alternative_strategies: string[];  // Backup plans and edge cases
    confidence_scoring: number;        // Data quality assessment
  };
}
```

#### 2. Quality Gates for Each Category
Before considering a category "complete":
- [ ] **Coverage**: All major intents within category addressed
- [ ] **Operational Reality**: Practical logistics documented for each option
- [ ] **Local Patterns**: City-specific quirks and cultural elements captured
- [ ] **Alternative Strategies**: Backup plans when primary options fail
- [ ] **Validation**: Local resident feedback confirms accuracy
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Special circumstances and accessibility needs addressed

### Category Development Timeline

#### Week 1-2: Foundation Repair
- Fix discovery API issues or implement alternative data collection
- Expand current cocktail bar dataset with additional venues
- Validate operational reality data for existing venues

#### Week 3-4: Essential Services Expansion

- Auto services and transportation needs
- Health and wellness access points

#### Week 5-6: Enhanced Food Categories

- Special circumstances accommodation

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Indicators
- **Category Completeness**: % of major intents covered within each category
- **Confidence Levels**: Average confidence score across all venues/services
- **Coverage Distribution**: Geographic spread across neighborhoods
- **Use Case Matching**: % of scenarios that have clear recommendations

### Qualitative Validation
- **Local Approval**: Residents say "yes, that's exactly right"
- **Visitor Success**: New arrivals avoid common mistakes
- **Decision Support**: Users can make confident choices
- **Cultural Accuracy**: Recommendations respect local patterns and values

## Long-term Vision

### Comprehensive City Intelligence
By the end of this buildout process, we should have:
1. **Complete Daily Life Support**: Every essential service mapped with operational reality
2. **Intent-Based Navigation**: Users find what they need by describing their situation
3. **Cultural Integration**: Recommendations that respect and explain local patterns
4. **Adaptive Intelligence**: System that updates with changing conditions
5. **Community Validation**: Local residents endorse the guide as accurate

### Scalability Foundation
This robust buildout approach should:
- Create replicable patterns for other cities
- Establish quality standards and validation methods
- Document local cultural integration techniques
- Build sustainable data collection and maintenance processes

**Philosophy**: Build the right thing thoroughly rather than rushing incomplete coverage. Focus on operational usefulness and cultural accuracy over raw quantity.
