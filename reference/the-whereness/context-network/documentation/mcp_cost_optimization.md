# MCP Cost Optimization Strategy

## Current Cost Structure (Clarified)

### Backend API Reality
- **Google Local Search** → SerpAPI backend (~$0.015 per search)
- **Yelp Business Search** → SerpAPI backend (~$0.015 per search)
- **Brave Search** → Direct Brave API (~$0.003 per search)
- **Tavily Search** → Direct Tavily API (~$0.008 per search)

### Cost Implications for 237 Queue Items

**Original Plan**: Use Google Local for all venue discovery
- **Cost**: 237 × $0.015 = **$3.55**
- **Benefits**: High-quality venue data with addresses, ratings, hours

**Optimized Plan**: Strategic API selection
- **Primary searches** (essential venues): 150 × $0.015 = $2.25
- **Supplemental searches** (validation, websites): 87 × $0.003 = $0.26
- **Total Cost**: **$2.51** (29% savings)

## Cost-Efficient Processing Strategy

### 1. Tier-Based API Selection

#### Tier 1 - Essential Services (Use SerpAPI-backed)
**Categories**: gas_stations, banking, grocery_markets, pharmacy, healthcare
**Rationale**: Need precise location data, hours, contact info
**API Choice**: `mcp__location__google-local-search` ($0.015)
**Items**: ~83 essential service searches

#### Tier 2 - Lifestyle Services (Mixed Approach)
**Categories**: restaurants, bars, breweries, coffee shops
**Strategy**:
- Primary venues: Google Local ($0.015)
- Additional research: Brave Search ($0.003)
**Items**: ~58 lifestyle searches

#### Tier 3 - Community Services (Use Brave Search)
**Categories**: museums, libraries, community centers
**Rationale**: Often have websites, less critical location precision
**API Choice**: `mcp__search__brave-search` ($0.003)
**Items**: ~56 community searches

### 2. Smart Batching Strategies

#### Geographic Clustering
```typescript
// Batch searches by neighborhood to maximize location API value
const searches = [
  { query: "gas station downtown Albuquerque", area: "central" },
  { query: "bank downtown Albuquerque", area: "central" },
  { query: "pharmacy downtown Albuquerque", area: "central" }
];
// Cost: 3 × $0.015 = $0.045 for comprehensive downtown coverage
```

#### Category Consolidation
```typescript
// Use broader searches when possible
const efficientSearch = "essential services Albuquerque"; // $0.015
// vs individual searches:
const inefficientSearches = [
  "gas station Albuquerque",    // $0.015
  "bank Albuquerque",           // $0.015
  "pharmacy Albuquerque"        // $0.015
]; // Total: $0.045 vs $0.015
```

### 3. Two-Phase Processing Approach

#### Phase 1: Core Venue Discovery (SerpAPI)
- Target: Fill critical gaps in essential services
- Budget: ~$1.25 for 83 essential service searches
- ROI: Maximum impact on gap closure

#### Phase 2: Supplemental Research (Brave Search)
- Target: Additional context, websites, validation
- Budget: ~$0.45 for 150 supplemental searches
- ROI: Enhanced venue data at minimal cost

## Practical Implementation

### Daily Processing Budget
**Conservative**: $0.25/day (16-17 searches)
- 12 Google Local searches ($0.18)
- 25 Brave searches ($0.07)

**Aggressive**: $0.50/day (30+ searches)
- 20 Google Local searches ($0.30)
- 65 Brave searches ($0.20)

### Weekly Batch Processing
**Week 1**: Essential Services Focus
- Gas stations, banking, grocery: 40 searches × $0.015 = $0.60
- Impact: Close critical infrastructure gaps

**Week 2**: Lifestyle Services
- Restaurants, bars, coffee: 30 searches × $0.015 = $0.45
- Supplemental research: 60 searches × $0.003 = $0.18
- Total: $0.63

**Week 3**: Community Services
- Museums, libraries, centers: 80 searches × $0.003 = $0.24
- Impact: Complete community infrastructure mapping

### Monthly Cost Projections
**Albuquerque Complete Setup**: ~$3.55 one-time
**Monthly Maintenance**: ~$2.00-3.00 per city
- New venue discovery: 50 searches × $0.015 = $0.75
- Validation/updates: 200 searches × $0.003 = $0.60
- Seasonal updates: 50 searches × $0.015 = $0.75

## ROI Analysis

### Cost vs. Value
**Investment**: $3.55 for complete Albuquerque venue discovery
**Returns**:
- 237 systematically discovered venues
- Complete gap filling in essential services
- Repeatable process for other cities
- Foundation for ongoing weekly updates

**Cost per venue**: $3.55 ÷ 237 = **$0.015 per venue**
**Comparison**: Manual research time = 5-10 minutes per venue = $5-15 per venue at $50/hour

### Scaling Economics
**3 Cities (Albuquerque, Minneapolis, Denver)**:
- Setup cost: 3 × $3.55 = $10.65
- Monthly maintenance: 3 × $2.50 = $7.50/month
- Annual cost: $10.65 + (12 × $7.50) = **$100.65/year for 3 cities**

**Cost per city per month**: ~$2.80 (including setup amortization)

## Monitoring and Optimization

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Cost per successful venue**: Target < $0.02
2. **API success rate**: Monitor failed searches
3. **Duplicate detection**: Avoid re-querying same venues
4. **Data quality score**: Confidence × completeness

### Optimization Triggers
- **High failure rate**: Switch from Brave to SerpAPI
- **Low data quality**: Add supplemental API calls
- **Budget overrun**: Increase Brave Search usage
- **Duplicate results**: Implement smart caching

### Cost Control Safeguards
```typescript
const DAILY_BUDGET = 0.50; // $0.50 per day
const SERPAPI_COST = 0.015;
const BRAVE_COST = 0.003;

let dailySpend = 0;

function smartAPICall(query: string, priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low') {
  if (priority === 'high' && dailySpend + SERPAPI_COST <= DAILY_BUDGET) {
    dailySpend += SERPAPI_COST;
    return mcp__location__google_local_search(query);
  } else if (dailySpend + BRAVE_COST <= DAILY_BUDGET) {
    dailySpend += BRAVE_COST;
    return mcp__search__brave_search(query);
  } else {
    throw new Error('Daily budget exceeded');
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Understanding that Google Local Search uses SerpAPI backend allows for more accurate cost planning:

- **Realistic budget**: $3.55 for complete city setup
- **Sustainable operations**: $2-3 per city per month
- **Strategic optimization**: Use cheaper Brave API for supplemental research
- **Excellent ROI**: $0.015 per venue vs. hours of manual research

The framework supports cost-controlled scaling while maintaining high data quality through strategic API selection.
