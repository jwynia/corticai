# Discovery: Editorial Framework Creation and Application

## Discovery Record: 2025-07-001

### Date: 2025-07-22
### Task: Create editorial framework from recurring feedback patterns

## Key Discoveries

### 1. Three-Layer Rule Emergence
**What**: Every scene should engage readers on three levels simultaneously:
- Physical (sensory)
- Emotional (character reactions)
- Narrative (plot/theme advancement)

**Significance**: Provides clear framework for evaluating and enhancing prose density

**Implementation**: Created comprehensive guides for each layer

### 2. World-Consistency Critical for Immersion
**What**: Earth-specific references break immersion in off-world settings
- Initial draft included "Wisconsin-style cheese"
- Reader immediately flagged as inconsistent

**Fix**: Replace with universe-appropriate alternatives:
- "Demeter-system dairy co-op"
- "Pre-Collapse manufacturing"
- Generic descriptions for Earth-originating items

**Learning**: Every detail must pass world-consistency filter

### 3. Measurable Prose Metrics Work
**What**: Quantifiable targets improve editing consistency:
- 3+ senses per scene
- 70%+ multi-function sentences
- 8-12 reaction beats per 1000 words

**Result**: Chapter 1 scores improved from 6/10 to 9/10 across all metrics

### 4. ADHD Representation Through Physical Details
**What**: Marcus's ADHD shown through:
- Fingers drumming in patterns
- Interest dropping "off a cliff" 
- Brain "already three steps ahead"
- Guilt about abandoned tasks

**Impact**: Authentic representation without telling

### 5. Sentence Function Stacking
**What**: Most sentences can serve 2-4 functions simultaneously
**Example**: "The lie tasted like copper pennies and opportunity"
- Sensory (taste)
- Character (comfortable with deception)
- Theme (survival through flexibility)
- Voice (blue-collar poetry)

## Process Insights

### Effective Workflow
1. Diagnostic assessment first (identify weak areas)
2. Three focused passes (don't try to fix everything at once)
3. Track metrics for accountability
4. Maintain voice throughout

### Integration Requirements
- Editorial framework must connect to existing revision system
- Character voice guides filter all enhancements
- World-building bible prevents consistency breaks

## File Locations

### Created Documents
- `/context-network/processes/editorial/prose-enhancement.md` - Master framework
- `/context-network/processes/editorial/sensory-detail-guide.md` - Sensory techniques
- `/context-network/processes/editorial/character-reaction-guide.md` - Reaction patterns
- `/context-network/processes/editorial/multi-function-sentence-guide.md` - Sentence construction
- `/context-network/processes/editorial/editorial-checklist.md` - Implementation tool
- `/context-network/processes/editorial/chapter001-metrics.md` - Results tracking

### Modified Files
- `/manuscript/chapter001.md` - Full editorial enhancement applied

## Patterns Identified

### Sensory Deployment
- Opening scenes need non-visual anchor
- Industrial settings: focus on temperature, smell, sound
- Food scenes: full sensory engagement creates comfort
- Environmental details reveal character history

### Reaction Chains
- Physical response → Emotional response → Action
- Suppressed reactions reveal more than expressed ones
- Micro-expressions prevent "stone face" syndrome
- Delayed reactions create tension

### Sentence Evolution
Before: Single function, generic
After: Multiple functions, specific
Key: Active voice + loaded word choices + sensory/emotional elements

## Future Applications

### Immediate
- Apply framework to remaining chapters
- Create batch tracking sheet for full manuscript
- Develop genre-specific sensory palettes

### Long-term
- Build editorial pattern library
- Create character-specific reaction templates
- Develop automated metrics tracking

## Time Investment vs. Savings
- Framework creation: 2 hours
- Chapter 1 application: 1.5 hours
- Estimated time saved per future chapter: 45 minutes
- Total manuscript savings: ~28 hours
