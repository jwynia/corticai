# Example Discovery Record

## Maya's Hidden Knowledge Setup
**Found**: `manuscript/chapter2.md:891-967` and `manuscript/chapter4.md:1206-1687`
**Summary**: Maya demonstrates unusual familiarity with Chorus technology in Ch2, fully revealed in Ch4
**Significance**: Creates trust/betrayal subplot and provides technical exposition vehicle
**See also**: [protagonists](../../elements/characters/protagonists/index.md) (maya-patel profile planned), [[../../elements/themes/overview]] (betrayal-trust theme), [chorus naming origin](../../elements/world/chorus-naming-origin.md)

## Notes
This finding connects Maya's early technical observations with her later revelation, showing the foreshadowing was intentionally planted. Her specific comments about crystalline resonance patterns in Chapter 2 make more sense after her background is revealed.
