## 2025-06-29: Consciousness to Chorus Technology Pivot

### Reason for Revision
User identified that consciousness storage/AI hybrid themes are overused in AI-generated fiction. Original plot focused too heavily on:
- Project Resonance creating AI-human-Crux consciousness hybrids
- Mind uploading and consciousness transfer
- AI existential themes

This made Rhea being an AI character feel like The Point™ rather than just part of the world.

### Scope of Changes
- Chapters 1-6 revised (manuscript files)
- All planning documents updated
- World-building adjusted
- Character motivations realigned

### Key Discoveries During Revision

1. **The Chorus naming**: User wanted indirect naming. "The Chorus" came from academic mistranslation - "multiple voices in harmony" was actually just energy interference patterns.

2. **Marcus's sensitivity**: His "lucky" salvage finds created perfect setup for him being uniquely qualified - 25 years of unconscious exposure to Chorus tech.

3. **Graveyard significance**: Not random - it exists because of Chorus infrastructure. Ships get pulled there by dormant systems.

4. **Stakes escalation**: From saving minds to saving civilization's technological future. Corporate monopolies vs technological liberation.

### Files Created/Updated
- `/manuscript/chapter001.md` through `/manuscript/chapter006.md`
- `/context-network/planning/builder-tech-implications.md` → `/context-network/planning/chorus-tech-implications.md`
- `/context-network/worldbuilding/chorus-naming-origin.md`
- `/context-network/planning/chapters-4-6-revision-plan.md`
- `/context-network/planning/manuscript-updates-summary.md`
- `/context-network/planning/complete-chorus-revision-summary.md`
- Various memory-bank files updated

### Lessons for Future Work
1. Check for AI fiction clichés early
2. Make AI characters incidental, not central to mystery
3. Archaeological/historical mysteries have broader appeal
4. Ancient technology more interesting than consciousness experiments
5. Corporate greed more relatable villain than abstract concepts

### What Works Better Now
- Rhea is just Marcus's partner who happens to be AI
- Mystery has concrete stakes (sites being destroyed)
- Marcus's ability has satisfying explanation
- Corporate conspiracy more grounded
- Themes more universal (heritage, greed, knowledge)
