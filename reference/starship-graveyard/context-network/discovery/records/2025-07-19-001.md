## Documentation Drift from Manuscript Reality

### What I Was Looking For
Plot structure documentation to understand story circle and mystery implementation

### What I Found
- **Plot Overview**: Still contained consciousness/AI hybrid themes
- **Character Overview**: Described Rhea exploring consciousness
- **Manuscript Reality**: Already fully revised as archaeological thriller
- **Critical Insight**: Documentation was 2+ months out of sync with manuscript

### Significance
This discovery reveals a dangerous pattern where planning documents can create confusion about the actual state of the work. When documentation doesn't match reality, it can lead to:
1. Redundant revision attempts
2. Confusion about genre and themes  
3. Misdirected future work
4. Time wasted "fixing" non-existent problems

### Evidence Locations
- **Outdated Docs**: `elements/plot/overview.md`, `elements/characters/overview.md`
- **Current Reality**: `manuscript/chapter001.md` through `chapter038.md`
- **Revision History**: `discovery/records/2025-07-18-006.md`

### Pattern Recognition
This is likely not isolated. Other documentation may also be outdated:
- Theme documents
- World-building guides  
- Chapter planning files
- Character voice guides

### Implications
1. **Need Documentation Audit Process**: Regular checks against manuscript
2. **Version Tracking**: Clear indicators of "current" vs "planned" state
3. **Update Triggers**: Manuscript changes should trigger doc updates
4. **Source of Truth**: Manuscript is reality, docs are maps

- [[genre-consistency-guide]] - Current genre requirements

### Follow-up Actions
- Audit all major documentation against manuscript
- Create "last synchronized" timestamps
- Establish documentation update checklist
- Define clear ownership of doc updates
