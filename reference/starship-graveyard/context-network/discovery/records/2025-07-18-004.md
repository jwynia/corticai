## Skeptical-Debunking Character Strategy

### What I Was Looking For
How to handle Marcus's mystical experiences without breaking character consistency

### What I Found
- **Author Insight**: "It's OK if other characters see things as mystical as long as Marcus's perspective and eventual revealed truth is that it isn't"
- **Metaphor**: "like feeling you might be in love only to discover it was food poisoning"
- **Chapter 31 Evidence**: Marcus already explicitly debunks mystical interpretations

### Significance
This elegantly solves the character consistency problem. Marcus can experience phenomena that drive the plot while maintaining his skeptical worldview. The truth ultimately validates his practical interpretation, reinforcing his character identity.

### Implementation Approach
1. Marcus feels something unusual
2. Immediately suspects practical cause (electromagnetic interference, infrasound, etc.)
3. Other characters may interpret mystically
4. Resolution proves Marcus's skepticism correct
5. Reinforces blue-collar "there's always a practical explanation" worldview

### Examples Created
- "feeling resonance" → "odd vibration—probably electromagnetic interference"
- "resonance sensitivity" → "pattern recognition from salvage experience"
- "felt its resonance calling" → "that odd sensation again—probably transmission frequency"
