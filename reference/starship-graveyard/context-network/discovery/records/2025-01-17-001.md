# Discovery: Character Names Already Correct

**Date**: 2025-01-17
**Context**: Investigating audit report claim about Dr. Vasquez → Dr. Zhou name inconsistency

## What I Was Looking For
Instances of "Dr. Vasquez" in manuscript that should be changed to "Dr. Zhou" based on character name decision.

## What I Found
**Location**: `manuscript/chapter002.md:96-104`, `manuscript/chapter004.md:113-387`
**Summary**: All instances of "Vasquez" refer to different characters (dock worker, competitor Carlos Vasquez, or Elena Vasquez), not the doctor character.

### Relevant Quote/Content
From chapter002.md:96-104:
```
A dock worker in grease-stained coveralls was securing cargo straps nearby. Marcus recognized him—Vasquez, one of the old-timers who'd been here since before the port expansion.

"Hey Vasquez," Marcus called out. "You were here when they brought the Serval in, right?"

Vasquez looked up, squinting in the afternoon sun. "Yeah, yesterday morning. Why?"
```

From chapter004.md:113:
```
"But you might know someone who has. Tell me about Carlos Vasquez."
```

## Significance
The audit report was based on outdated information. The character name changes have already been properly implemented throughout the manuscript. This shows the importance of verifying issues before attempting fixes.
