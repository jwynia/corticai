# Discovery Record: Chapter Numbering Fix

## What I Was Looking For
Incorrect chapter numbering in chapters 32-39 (showing as 31-38)

## Found
- **8 files** with incorrect chapter headers at:
  - `manuscript/chapter032.md` through `manuscript/chapter039.md`
  - All were labeled one number too low

## Summary
Successfully corrected all chapter headers to match their file names. Changed headers from "Chapter 31-38" to correct "Chapter 32-39".

## Significance
This fixes a basic formatting inconsistency that could confuse readers and makes the manuscript consistent with the new structure after adding the false victory chapter.

## Changes Made
1. chapter032.md: "# Chapter 31" → "# Chapter 32"
2. chapter033.md: "# Chapter 32" → "# Chapter 33"
3. chapter034.md: "# Chapter 33" → "# Chapter 34"
4. chapter035.md: "# Chapter 34" → "# Chapter 35"
5. chapter036.md: "# Chapter 35" → "# Chapter 36"
6. chapter037.md: "# Chapter 36" → "# Chapter 37"
7. chapter038.md: "# Chapter 37" → "# Chapter 38"
8. chapter039.md: "# Chapter 38: Epilogue" → "# Chapter 39: Epilogue"
