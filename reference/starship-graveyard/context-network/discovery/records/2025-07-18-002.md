## Genre Drift from Slice-of-Life to Consciousness Thriller

### What I Was Looking For
Overall story structure and tonal consistency across the manuscript

### What I Found
- **Chapter 1**: Slice-of-life blue-collar noir (Marcus making breakfast, worrying about loans)
- **Chapters 5-25**: Archaeological crime thriller (heists, corporate conspiracy)
- **Chapter 30**: Alien consciousness/first contact elements introduced
- **Chapter 38**: Return to grounded tone but with cosmic mystery seeds

### Significance
The manuscript underwent significant genre drift, moving from the grounded blue-collar tone established in Chapter 1 (which the author wrote personally) toward AI consciousness themes that the context network documents as explicitly rejected in June 2025 revisions.

### Evidence Locations
- `manuscript/chapter001.md`: Leisurely breakfast scene, loan worries
- `manuscript/chapter019.md`: Active heist at Stellarion warehouse
- `manuscript/chapter030.md`: Introduction of cosmic-scale mysteries
- `context-network/planning/revision-complete-summary.md`: Documents rejection of consciousness themes

### Implications
1. Reader expectations set by opening don't match story evolution
2. Revisions to chapters 1-6 successfully removed consciousness themes
3. Chapters 7-38 still contain elements that were supposedly removed
4. Need consistent genre framework throughout
