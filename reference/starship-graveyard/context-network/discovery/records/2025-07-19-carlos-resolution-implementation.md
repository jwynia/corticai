## What I Was Looking For
Implementation of Carlos Vasquez resolution scenes based on planning document

## Found
- **Chapter 27 Addition**: Added scene at `manuscript/chapter027.md:175-233`
- **Chapter 29 Addition**: Added follow-up at `manuscript/chapter029.md:55-75`

## Summary
Successfully implemented Carlos Vasquez resolution as two connected scenes showing how rival salvagers realize they were manipulated by Stellarion to fight each other instead of recognizing their common enemy.

## Significance
This implementation:
1. Resolves the rival salvager subplot with thematic consistency
2. Reinforces working-class solidarity theme
3. Shows how corporations divide communities
4. Provides additional evidence for the case
5. Creates realistic relationship evolution (not friends, but not enemies)

## Key Elements Added

### Chapter 27 Scene (After Broadcast)
- Carlos calls after seeing Stellarion news
- Reveals Emerson approached him first
- Shows pattern of sabotage for refusing to help
- "They wanted us so busy fighting each other..."
- Agreement to meet and share evidence

### Chapter 29 Scene (Port Shop)
- Carlos visits Marcus's new shop
- Confirms evidence helped prosecution
- Professional handshake and respect
- "Maybe we don't undercut each other..."
- One less enemy in the universe

## Theme Reinforcement
Both scenes support the core theme that working-class people have more in common with each other than with the corporations that exploit them. The rivalry was real but was also amplified and weaponized by Stellarion.

## Character Growth
- Marcus: Learns to see bigger picture of manipulation
- Carlos: Overcomes pride to acknowledge being played
- Both: Maintain realistic boundaries (not sudden friendship)
