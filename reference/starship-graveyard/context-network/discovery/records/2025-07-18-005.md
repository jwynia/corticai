## Implementation of Character Consistency Revisions

### What I Was Looking For
Specific passages where Marcus exhibited mystical abilities that needed revision

### What I Found
- **Chapter 13, Lines 139 & 143**: Marcus having "sensitivity to Chorus artifacts"
- **Chapter 14, Multiple lines**: Marcus "feeling resonance" and having special abilities
- **Clean Implementation**: Only 11 specific passages needed revision across 38 chapters

### Revisions Implemented

#### Chapter 13
- "sensitivity to Chorus artifacts" → "noticing details...from years of salvage work"
- "perceive Chorus resonance" → "recognize Chorus artifacts from his salvage work"

#### Chapter 14
- "feeling resonance" → "feeling odd vibration—probably electromagnetic interference"
- "resonance patterns he'd felt" → "strange sensations...probably electromagnetic interference"
- "resonance scanner" → "quantum scanner"
- "resonance sensitivity" → "growing familiarity with quantum patterns"
- Multiple similar technical replacements

### Significance
The revision was surprisingly surgical - most of the manuscript already portrayed Marcus correctly as skeptical and practical. The mystical elements were concentrated in specific chapters and easily addressed without major structural changes.

### Verification Results
- No remaining "resonance" references in manuscript
- No remaining "sensitivity" references
- No remaining mystical Marcus passages
- Character consistency restored throughout
