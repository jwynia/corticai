# Discovery Record: Actual Genre Consistency State

## What I Was Looking For
Evidence of genre drift into consciousness/mystical themes in chapters 32-39

## Found
- **Chapter 32** (labeled as 31): Actually maintains genre consistency well
- **Chapter 33** (labeled as 32): Continues practical approach
- Current manuscript shows significant revision from what genre drift analysis described

## Summary
The manuscript has already been revised to address most genre consistency issues. The current version treats preservation sites as sophisticated but non-mystical technology, and Marcus as a skilled salvager, not someone with special powers.

## Key Positive Elements Found

### Chapter 32 Strengths:
1. **Industrial Setting**: "warehouse smelled like machine oil and old cargo pallets, not mystical alien technology"
2. **Practical Expertise**: Marcus succeeds because he treats sites "like a salvager approaching broken equipment"
3. **No Special Powers**: "Nothing special. No mystical connection, no chosen one destiny"
4. **Technical Problem**: Sites running diagnostic cycles, not awakening consciousness
5. **Corporate Crime Focus**: Solari planning to strip sites for rare metals

### Chapter 33 Strengths:
1. **Maintenance Approach**: Standard maintenance corridor and panels
2. **Technical Solution**: Authorization protocols and storage redistribution
3. **Salvage Yard Analogy**: Marcus thinks in terms of practical storage problems
4. **No Mysticism**: Everything explained through technical systems

## Remaining Issues to Check

### Minor Concerns:
1. Chapter numbering is off by one (showing 31 instead of 32, etc.)
2. Need to verify later chapters maintain this approach
3. Some language could be tightened ("network waking up" â†’ "network responding")

### Still Need to Verify:
- Chapters 34-39 for any regression to consciousness themes
- Epilogue for first contact setup
- Any instances of Marcus having "special" abilities

## Significance
This is excellent news - the manuscript is in much better shape than the planning documents suggested. The revision work to maintain genre consistency has largely been completed. We just need to:
1. Fix chapter numbering
2. Check remaining chapters
3. Make minor language adjustments
