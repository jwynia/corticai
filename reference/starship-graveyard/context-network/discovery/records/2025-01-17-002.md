# Discovery: Wiki-Style Links Causing Navigation Issues

**Date**: 2025-01-17
**Context**: Running context network audit and finding broken links

## What I Was Looking For
Understanding why so many links were reported as broken in the audit.

## What I Found
**Location**: Throughout context network, identified via `check_links_better.sh`
**Summary**: The network uses wiki-style links like-this extensively, but many target files don't exist or use different names than expected.

## Significance
This explains the 372 broken links reported. Wiki-style links require exact filename matches and don't validate at creation time. This is a systemic issue affecting navigation throughout the network.
