# Value Shift Framework

## Purpose
Framework for creating meaningful change in scenes through shifts in significant values, ensuring every scene serves a narrative purpose.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Scene Dynamics
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Abstraction:** Core Principle
- **Confidence:** Very High

## Core Components

### Opening Value
- Initial state of significant value
- Establishes scene baseline
- Can be positive or negative
- Sets expectations

### Complication
- Forces that challenge value state
- Creates instability
- Demands response
- Generates tension

### Crisis
- Dilemma forcing difficult choices
- Value directly threatened
- No perfect solution
- Character revealing moment

### Climax
- Action taken determining outcome
- Choice made under pressure
- Value fate decided
- Consequences initiated

### New Value
- Resulting state after climax
- Must differ from opening
- Can be better/worse/transformed
- Creates progression

## Key Value Dimensions

### Life/Death
- Physical survival
- Health and safety
- Vitality levels
- Mortality awareness

### Love/Hate
- Connection relationships
- Emotional bonds
- Trust and betrayal
- Intimacy levels

### Freedom/Slavery
- Autonomy levels
- Choice availability
- Control dynamics
- Independence state

### Truth/Lie
- Knowledge and honesty
- Understanding levels
- Deception presence
- Reality perception

### Power/Weakness

### Justice/Injustice

### Hope/Despair

## Application Process

### Scene Planning
1. Identify primary value at stake
2. Determine opening state (+/-)
3. Plan meaningful shift
4. Design crisis around value
5. Ensure new state differs

### Value Selection
- Match to genre expectations
- Align with character arc
- Support thematic concerns
- Vary across scenes

### Shift Patterns
- **Positive to Negative:** Things worsen
- **Negative to Positive:** Things improve
- **Negative to Double Negative:** Things worsen dramatically
- **Positive to Double Positive:** Unexpected triumph
- **Value Transformation:** Nature of value changes

## Scene-Level Implementation

### Establishing Value
- Make value clear early
- Show through action/dialogue
- Connect to character goals
- Set measurable state

### Creating Crisis
- Threaten established value
- Force impossible choice
- No escape routes
- Time pressure

### Executing Shift
- Show decision moment
- Make consequences clear
- New state observable
- Change irreversible

## Multi-Level Values

### Scene Values
- Immediate scene concern
- Drives scene action
- Creates local tension
- Resolves within scene

### Sequence Values
- Spans multiple scenes
- Builds through stages
- Accumulates impact
- Major story beats

### Story Values
- Overall narrative arc
- Ultimate transformation
- Thematic expression
- Final resolution

## Common Problems

### Static Scenes
- No value change
- Activity without progress
- Wasted narrative space
- Reader disengagement

### Unclear Values
- Value not established
- Stakes ambiguous
- Change unmeasurable
- Impact uncertain

### Forced Shifts
- Change feels arbitrary
- Lacks setup
- Unconvincing crisis
- Artificial resolution
