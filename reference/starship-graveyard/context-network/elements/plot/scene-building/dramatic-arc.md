## Purpose
The universally recognized framework describing the fundamental tension pattern that forms the foundation of most compelling narratives.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Scene Structure
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Abstraction:** Foundational
- **Confidence:** Very High

## Key Components

### 1. Exposition
- Introduction of characters, setting, and initial situation
- Establishes baseline emotional state
- Sets up reader expectations
- Provides necessary context

### 2. Rising Action
- Development of conflict and complications
- Escalating stakes and tension
- Character attempts to resolve conflict
- Introduction of obstacles

### 3. Climax
- Point of highest tension and decisive action
- Central conflict reaches peak intensity
- Character makes crucial choice or takes action
- Turning point of the narrative

### 4. Falling Action

- Tension begins to release
- Results become apparent
- New reality takes shape

### 5. Resolution
- Final state and new equilibrium established
- Loose ends addressed
- Emotional closure provided
- Transformation complete

## Application Guidelines

### Scene Level
- Miniature arc within individual scenes
- Creates satisfying scene structure
- Ensures meaningful progress

### Sequence Level
- Arc spanning multiple related scenes
- Builds toward sequence climax
- Creates narrative momentum

### Overall Narrative
- Master arc for entire story
- Subordinate arcs support main arc
- Provides structural coherence

### Cross-Media Application
- Works across genres and formats
- Scales from micro to macro levels
- Universal emotional resonance

## Common Variations

### Truncated Arc
- Begins in media res (middle of action)
- Skips or minimizes exposition
- Useful for immediate engagement

### Extended Arc
- Multiple rising action peaks
- Delayed climax for suspense
- Complex resolution phase

### Inverted Arc
- Begins with climactic moment
- Works backward to reveal context
- Creates mystery and intrigue

## Implementation Notes
- Not rigid formula but flexible framework
- Adjust proportions for genre/medium
