# Narrative Causality Framework

## Purpose
Framework emphasizing the essential cause-and-effect relationships that create coherent, compelling plot structures where events flow logically from character decisions.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Plot Logic
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Abstraction:** Foundational
- **Confidence:** Very High

## Key Principles

### Causality Chain
- Events must follow logically from previous events
- Each scene consequence of prior action
- No random or unmotivated occurrences
- Clear through-line of cause and effect

### Character Agency
- Events primarily result from character decisions
- Characters drive plot, not vice versa
- Choices have meaningful consequences
- Agency creates investment

### Plausible Motivation
- Character decisions stem from established traits
- Motivations consistent with character
- Actions believable within context
- Growth allows motivation evolution

### Proportional Response
- Reactions proportionate to causes
- Small causes → small effects
- Major causes → major effects
- Escalation follows logical progression

### Setup and Payoff
- Significant elements established before importance
- No deus ex machina solutions
- Foreshadowing creates satisfaction
- Everything introduced has purpose

## Testing Methods

### "Therefore/But" Test
- Connect scenes with "therefore" or "but"
- Not "and then" connections
- **Good:** "She discovers the truth, THEREFORE she confronts him"
- **Bad:** "She goes shopping, AND THEN aliens attack"

### Decision Mapping
- Track character decisions through narrative
- Identify decision consequences
- Verify decisions drive major plot points
- Ensure meaningful alternatives existed

### Motivation Verification
- List character actions
- Identify motivation for each
- Check consistency with character
- Verify setup for major decisions

## Implementation Strategies

### Forward Planning
1. Establish character goals/motivations
2. Create obstacles to goals
3. Plan character responses
4. Determine logical consequences
5. Build next obstacle from consequences

### Reverse Engineering
1. Start with desired outcome
2. Work backward to find causes
3. Ensure character decisions create path
4. Plant necessary setups
5. Verify logical flow

### Middle-Out Development
1. Identify key dramatic moments
2. Determine what must cause them
3. Plan consequences flowing from them
4. Connect causation chains
5. Fill gaps with character decisions

## Common Violations

### Coincidence Abuse
- Random events solve problems
- Unmotivated character arrivals
- Lucky breaks without setup
- Information appears when needed

### Plot Convenience
- Characters act against nature
- Sudden skill acquisition
- Forgotten abilities/knowledge
- Arbitrary rule changes

### Missing Links
- Jumps in logic
- Unexplained developments
- Character knowledge gaps
- Unmotivated changes

## Scene-Level Application

### Scene Entry
- Clear cause for scene occurring
- Character motivated to be present
- Previous scene consequences active
- Logical time/place progression

### Scene Development
- Character decisions create events
- Obstacles arise from setup
- Complications follow logically
- Choices have alternatives

### Scene Exit
- Clear consequences established
- Next scene motivation created
- Character decisions matter
- Cause-effect chain continues
