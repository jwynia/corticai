# Social Media Narrative Integration Frameworks

## Classification
- **Domain:** Plot Development - Digital Era
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Methodological
- **Confidence:** Established

## Purpose
Frameworks for adapting traditional narrative structures to social media platforms, optimizing for platform constraints while maintaining narrative impact.

## Frameworks

### Three-Act Structure for Social Media
- **Definition:** An adaptation of the classic three-act structure (setup, confrontation, resolution) optimized for concise social media storytelling.
- **Key Components:**
  - Compressed setup phase with immediate hook
  - Accelerated conflict introduction
  - Rapid resolution with clear takeaway
  - Visual punctuation between acts
- **Application Guidelines:**
  - Design introductions that establish context within seconds
  - Create visual/textual patterns to signal act transitions
  - Develop resolution that encourages sharing or further engagement
  - Balance brevity with sufficient emotional resonance
- **Implementation Process:**
  1. Identify core narrative in single-sentence form
  2. Develop visual hook that establishes context
  3. Create conflict or question that drives middle section
  4. Design resolution that feels both satisfying and shareable
  5. Add platform-appropriate engagement prompts

### Freytag's Pyramid Adaptation for Short-Form Content
- **Definition:** A modified five-act structure (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, d√©nouement) compressed for digital formats while preserving dramatic impact.
- **Key Components:**
  - Exposition integrated with inciting incident
  - Accelerated rising action with clear progression
  - Visually/emotionally distinct climactic moment
  - Compressed falling action and resolution
- **Application Guidelines:**
  - Establish exposition through visual context rather than explanation
  - Use pacing variation to create sense of building momentum
  - Design distinct visual/audio cues for climactic moment
  - Create resolution that connects to beginning element
- **Examples:** Documentary-style TikTok series, Instagram story narratives with episodic structure

### Before-After-Bridge Framework
- **Definition:** A three-part narrative structure showing current state ("before"), desired future ("after"), and pathway connecting them ("bridge").
- **Key Components:**
  - Relatable "before" state that resonates with audience
  - Aspirational "after" state visualizing improvement
  - Practical "bridge" explaining transformation process
  - Clear causal connection between elements
- **Application Guidelines:**
  - Use authentic, relatable elements in "before" state
  - Create emotionally compelling contrast in "after" state
  - Develop credible, actionable "bridge" between states
  - Maintain consistent character/setting across all three phases
- **Implementation Process:**
  1. Identify pain point or challenge for "before" state
  2. Visualize improved condition for "after" state
  3. Develop clear pathway connecting the states
  4. Create consistent visual language across all phases

### Problem-Agitate-Solve Framework
- **Definition:** A narrative structure that identifies a problem, intensifies the emotional impact of that problem, then introduces a solution.
- **Key Components:**
  - Clear problem identification that resonates with audience
  - Emotional agitation phase highlighting consequences
  - Solution presentation with clear implementation path
  - Consistent narrative voice across all three phases
- **Application Guidelines:**
  - Focus on universal or audience-specific problems
  - Use storytelling techniques during agitation phase
  - Present solution with emphasis on transformation
  - Incorporate proof elements to establish credibility
- **Variant: PASTOR Framework:**
  - Person/Problem: Identify audience and challenge
  - Amplify: Intensify consequences of problem
  - Story/Solution: Present narrative illustrating solution
  - Transformation: Show before/after contrast
  - Offer: Provide clear next steps
  - Response: Include call to action

### Hero's Journey Adaptation for Brand Storytelling
- **Definition:** A condensed version of Campbell's monomyth structure adapted for digital platforms where audiences are positioned as heroes encountering challenges.
- **Key Components:**
  - Audience as hero (rather than brand)
  - Challenge/ordinary world establishment
  - Brand as mentor/magical aid
  - Transformation through product/service
  - Return with newfound capability/knowledge
- **Application Guidelines:**
  - Position audience clearly as protagonist
  - Establish relatable ordinary world challenges
  - Introduce brand as guide rather than hero
  - Showcase transformation through authentic stories
  - Create shareable resolution that inspires others
- **Digital Adaptation Considerations:**
  - Compress cycle for platform attention constraints
  - Use visual storytelling to imply rather than explain stages
  - Create participation opportunities at key journey points
  - Design for multi-episode engagement when appropriate
