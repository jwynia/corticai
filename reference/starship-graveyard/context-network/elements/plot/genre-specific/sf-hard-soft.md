# Hard vs Soft Science Fiction Structures

## Purpose
Framework distinguishing between hard and soft science fiction narrative structures, each with distinct approaches to scientific accuracy, pacing, and thematic exploration.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Science Fiction Structure
- **Stability:** Established
- **Abstraction:** Comparative Framework
- **Confidence:** High

## Hard SF Structure

### Core Characteristics

- Rigorous cause-effect chains
- Technical problem-solving focus
- Extrapolation from known science

### Narrative Patterns
1. **Problem Introduction**
   - Scientific challenge presented
   - Parameters established
   - Constraints defined
   - Stakes clarified

2. **Investigation Phase**
   - Data gathering
   - Hypothesis formation
   - Testing procedures
   - Failure analysis

3. **Solution Development**
   - Scientific principles applied
   - Innovation within constraints
   - Verification process
   - Implementation challenges

4. **Resolution**
   - Problem solved/managed
   - Consequences explored
   - New understanding gained
   - Future implications

### Pacing Elements
- Thriller-like progression
- Technical exposition integrated
- Action through problem-solving
- Tension from constraints

### Character Focus
- Scientists/engineers prominent
- Competence as virtue
- Rationality valued
- Team dynamics common

### Examples
- Andy Weir's *The Martian*
- Arthur C. Clarke's works
- Kim Stanley Robinson's *Mars* trilogy
- Gregory Benford's *Timescape*

## Soft SF Structure

### Core Characteristics

   - Speculative element presented
   - Social context established
   - Human impact shown
   - Questions raised

2. **Exploration Phase**
   - Multiple perspectives
   - Consequences unfold
   - Relationships tested
   - Values challenged

3. **Complication Development**
   - Unintended effects
   - Moral dilemmas
   - Social transformation
   - Personal stakes

4. **Thematic Resolution**
   - Philosophical insight
   - Character transformation
   - Social commentary
   - Open questions

### Pacing Elements
- Literary fiction influence
- Character-driven progression
