**Purpose:** Partially true misdirection
**Plausibility:** Corporations involved

**Narrative Value:** Introduces corporate antagonists

**Narrative Value:** Establishes financial pressures

## Reader Experience Design

### Information Management
1. **Breadcrumb Trail**: Each clue leads logically to next
2. **Multiple Interpretations**: Evidence supports various theories
3. **Progressive Revelation**: Understanding deepens over time
4. **Satisfying Connections**: Earlier clues gain new meaning

### Pacing Considerations
- **Early Hooks**: Body discovery creates urgency
- **Mid-Story Escalation**: Stakes rise with each revelation
- **False Victories**: Apparent solutions prove incomplete
- **Final Satisfaction**: All threads resolve logically

### Genre Consistency
- **No Mystical Elements**: All clues have technical explanations
- **Working-Class Perspective**: Marcus's practical approach
- **Corporate Villains**: Greed as primary motivation
- **Human Stakes**: Justice and preservation, not cosmic destiny
