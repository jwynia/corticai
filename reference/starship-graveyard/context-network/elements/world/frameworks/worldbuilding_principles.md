# Foundational Worldbuilding Principles

## Classification
- **Domain:** Worldbuilding - Foundational Theory
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Methodological  
- **Confidence:** Initial Research

## Purpose
Core principles that appear consistently across multiple authoritative sources and represent fundamental approaches to effective worldbuilding.

## Principles

### 1. Consistency Principle

The principle of internal consistency is perhaps the most universally emphasized worldbuilding principle across sources. A world must operate according to its own established rules, whether those align with our reality or diverge from it.

- **Key Aspects:**
  - Establish clear rules for how your world operates (physical, magical, technological, social)
  - Document these rules to ensure consistent application
  - Test new elements against established rules
  - When breaking established rules, provide logical explanations that fit within the world's framework

- **Application:**
  - Create a "laws of the world" document that outlines fundamental principles
  - Develop consistency checkers for different world aspects (physics, magic, technology, culture)
  - Establish cause-and-effect relationships that remain consistent

### 2. Iceberg Principle

This widely-cited principle states that creators should develop extensive world details while only revealing a fraction to the audience. Like an iceberg where only 10% is visible above water, the 90% of worldbuilding that remains hidden provides depth and consistency.

- **Key Aspects:**
  - Develop substantially more detail than will be explicitly shown
  - Allow hidden details to influence visible elements
  - Reveal world details organically through story rather than exposition
  - Create the sense of a living world that exists beyond the immediate narrative

- **Application:**
  - Develop detailed histories, cultures, and systems
  - Allow these hidden elements to influence character decisions and backgrounds
  - Strategically reveal details that enhance the immediate narrative

### 3. Interconnection Principle

This principle emphasizes that world elements should not exist in isolation but should influence and shape each other, creating a web of relationships that mimics the complexity of real-world systems.

- **Key Aspects:**
  - Connect geographical features to cultural development
  - Link resource distribution to political and economic systems
  - Tie historical events to current social structures
  - Connect belief systems to daily practices and traditions

- **Application:**
  - Create relationship maps between world elements
  - Test each element by identifying at least three connections to other elements
  - Use "if this, then what else?" questioning to explore consequences

### 4. Familiar-Strange Balance

This principle addresses the tension between creating worlds that are comprehensible to audiences (familiar) while still being distinctive and engaging (strange). Sources consistently emphasize the need to balance these elements.

- **Key Aspects:**
  - Anchor unfamiliar elements with familiar contexts
  - Use recognizable patterns but with distinctive variations
  - Provide reference points for readers to understand alien concepts
  - Carefully manage the cognitive load of world distinctiveness

- **Application:**
  - For each strange element, identify familiar elements that can provide context
  - Use cultural parallels that audiences can relate to
  - Introduce unfamiliar elements gradually, allowing audiences to acclimate

### 5. Economy of Invention Principle

This principle recommends focusing creative energy on elements that most significantly impact the narrative, while leveraging established conventions for less central elements. This creates efficiency in worldbuilding while maintaining distinctiveness.

- **Key Aspects:**
  - Identify which world elements are most central to your specific narrative
  - Allocate creative resources proportionally to element importance
  - Use familiar conventions for background elements
  - Subvert expectations and create uniqueness in focal elements

- **Application:**
  - Rank world elements by narrative importance
  - Develop detailed inventions for high-impact elements
  - Use familiar frameworks for less central aspects
