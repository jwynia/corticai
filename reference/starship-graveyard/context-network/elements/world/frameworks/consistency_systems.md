# World Consistency Systems

## Classification
- **Domain:** Worldbuilding - Quality Assurance
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Methodological
- **Confidence:** Initial Research

## Purpose
Methodologies for maintaining consistency throughout worldbuilding, ensuring internal coherence and logical development of world elements.

## Systems

### 1. Consequence Mapping

A systematic process for exploring the implications of worldbuilding decisions to ensure consistency throughout the world.

**Mapping Process:**
1. Identify a world element (physical law, technology, custom, etc.)
2. Ask "what direct consequences would this create?"
3. For each consequence, ask "what secondary effects would this cause?"
4. Continue exploring chains of consequences through multiple iterations
5. Identify potential contradictions with other established elements
6. Resolve contradictions by adjusting elements or explaining special circumstances

### 2. Cultural-Environmental Feedback Loop

A system for ensuring cultures logically develop in response to their environments while also shaping those environments.

**Feedback Process:**
1. Establish initial environmental conditions
2. Determine logical cultural adaptations to these conditions
3. Identify how these adaptations would reshape the environment
4. Develop cultural responses to these environmental changes
5. Continue this cycle through multiple iterations to create depth

### 3. Timeline Consistency Verification

A system for maintaining chronological consistency throughout a world's history.

**Verification Process:**
1. Create a master timeline of key world events
2. Establish development rates for technologies, cultures, languages, etc.
3. For each new historical element, position it on the timeline
4. Verify that its development state matches surrounding elements
5. Check for ripple effects on subsequent historical events
6. Ensure character knowledge aligns with historical position

## Implementation Notes
Apply these systems regularly throughout worldbuilding to catch inconsistencies early. Use them both proactively during development and reactively when reviewing existing work.
