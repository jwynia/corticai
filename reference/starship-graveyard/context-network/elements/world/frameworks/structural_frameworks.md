# Structural Worldbuilding Frameworks

## Classification
- **Domain:** Worldbuilding - Construction Methods
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Methodological
- **Confidence:** Initial Research

## Purpose
Methodological approaches to constructing worlds in a systematic manner, providing step-by-step frameworks for building coherent worlds from the ground up.

## Frameworks

### 1. GRAPES Framework

A geography-based structural approach focused on the fundamental physical, social, and cultural systems that form a coherent world.

- **G**eography: Physical environments, climate, terrain, and natural resources
- **R**eligion: Belief systems, metaphysics, and spiritual practices
- **A**chievement: Technology, innovation, art, and cultural accomplishments
- **P**olitics: Governance structures, power dynamics, and decision-making systems
- **E**conomics: Resource management, trade, currency, and wealth distribution
- **S**ocial Structure: Class systems, family units, social organizations, and cultural norms

**Application Process:**
1. Develop each category separately, documenting key elements
2. Identify interconnections between categories
3. Test for consistency across the system
4. Develop historical context that explains how these systems evolved

### 2. Historical Layering Framework

This approach builds worlds through chronological development, creating historical layers that explain how the current state evolved.

**Layer Components:**
1. **Foundation Layer:** Natural environment and initial conditions
2. **Settlement Layer:** How populations established themselves
3. **Development Layer:** Early cultural and technological evolution
4. **Conflict Layer:** Key conflicts that shaped societies
5. **Resolution Layer:** How conflicts were resolved or continue
6. **Contemporary Layer:** Current state resulting from previous layers

**Application Process:**
1. Establish the foundation layer with geography and natural resources
2. Determine settlement patterns based on these resources
3. Develop cultural and technological evolution in response to conditions
4. Identify key conflicts arising from competing interests
5. Establish resolutions or ongoing tensions from these conflicts
6. Document the contemporary world as a product of this history

### 3. Character-Centric Worldbuilding

This framework builds outward from character experience, ensuring worlds remain relevant to narrative needs while still developing comprehensive depth.

**Concentric Circles:**
1. **Immediate Environment:** Character's daily interaction sphere
2. **Community/Society:** Social structures directly affecting characters
3. **Regional Context:** Broader geographical and political environment
4. **World Systems:** Global or universal systems with indirect influence
5. **Historical/Metaphysical Background:** Underlying foundations rarely directly encountered

**Application Process:**
1. Identify main character perspectives
2. Develop immediate environments in detail
3. Establish community structures that shape character experiences
4. Create regional contexts that influence communities
5. Develop world systems that provide broader context
6. Establish historical and metaphysical backgrounds that explain world development

### 4. Cultural Development Framework

This framework focuses on developing distinctive and believable cultures as the core of worldbuilding.

**Cultural Components:**
1. **Core Values:** Fundamental beliefs and priorities
2. **Expression Systems:** Art, ritual, language, and symbolism
3. **Social Organization:** Family, community, and governance structures
4. **Resource Management:** Economic systems and approaches to scarcity
5. **Adaptation Mechanisms:** How the culture responds to challenges
6. **Evolution Patterns:** How the culture changes over time

**Application Process:**
1. Establish core values based on environmental conditions and history
2. Develop expression systems that reflect these values
3. Create social organizations that enact and reinforce values
4. Design resource management systems appropriate to environment and values
5. Establish adaptation mechanisms for facing challenges
6. Map evolution patterns showing how the culture changes
