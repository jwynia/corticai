# Archaeological Site Naming System - Realistic Designations for Chorus Sites

## Purpose
Replace pulpy "Gamma-12" style designations with realistic archaeological site naming that reflects actual discovery, academic, and corporate practices.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Worldbuilding
- **Stability:** Reference
- **Abstraction:** System
- **Confidence:** High

## Core Principles

### Multiple Naming Layers
Real archaeological sites have multiple designations used by different groups:
1. **Discovery Designation** - Who found it, when, where
2. **Academic/Cultural Name** - What researchers call it based on significance
3. **Corporate Asset Code** - Internal tracking for business purposes
4. **Local/Indigenous Name** - What the original civilization called it (if known)

### Realistic Naming Patterns
Based on actual archaeological and astronomical naming conventions:
- Star system + planet + site number + discoverer/year
- Cultural significance descriptors
- Geographic markers
- Administrative codes

## The New System

### Discovery Designation Format
**Pattern**: [Star System][Planet] Site [Number] ([Lead Researcher] [Discovery Year])

**Examples**:
- Kepler-442c Site 7 (Reeves 2387)
- Proxima Centauri b Site 3 (Chen Survey 2389)
- Tau Ceti e Site 12 (Meridian Excavation 2390)
- Wolf 359c Site 1 (Patel-Reeves Joint 2385)
- Ross 128b Site 9 (Stellarion Survey 2388)

### Academic/Cultural Names
Researchers often give sites descriptive names based on their most significant features:

**Pattern**: "The [Distinctive Feature]" or "[Function] Complex"

**Examples**:
- Kepler-442c Site 7 → "The Harmonic Chambers" (for resonance-based architecture)
- Proxima Centauri b Site 3 → "The Spiral Archive" (for helical data storage structures)
- Tau Ceti e Site 12 → "The Resonance Gardens" (for bio-acoustic cultivation systems)
- Wolf 359c Site 1 → "The Memory Palace" (for cognitive enhancement chambers)
- Ross 128b Site 9 → "The Temporal Observatory" (for time-measurement instruments)

### Corporate Asset Codes
**Stellarion Internal Format**: [System Code]-[Planet][Site]-[Discovery Code][Year]

**Examples**:
- K442-C7-R87 (Kepler-442c Site 7, Reeves 2387)
- PC-B3-CS89 (Proxima Centauri b Site 3, Chen Survey 2389)
- TC-E12-ME90 (Tau Ceti e Site 12, Meridian Excavation 2390)
- W359-C1-PR85 (Wolf 359c Site 1, Patel-Reeves 2385)
- R128-B9-SS88 (Ross 128b Site 9, Stellarion Survey 2388)

### Chorus Indigenous Names (When Known)
The Chorus civilization had their own names for these places. Trizik might know some:

**Examples**:
- "Vel'thari Nexus" (The Harmonic Chambers - place of sound-learning)
- "Mor'dun Archive" (The Spiral Archive - place of memory-keeping)
- "Keth'var Gardens" (The Resonance Gardens - place of life-singing)
- "Nal'seth Palace" (The Memory Palace - place of mind-touching)
- "Thren'dai Observatory" (The Temporal Observatory - place of time-watching)

## Site Inventory - Current Story

## Regional Scope Definition

### The Proxima Sector
**Geographic Scope**: 2.5 star systems within 25 light-years of Sol
- **Primary**: Proxima Centauri system (3 sites)
- **Secondary**: Wolf 359 system (2 sites)
- **Tertiary**: Ross 128 system (4 sites)
- **Extended**: Tau Ceti system (3 sites)
- **Frontier**: Kepler-442 system (1 site, furthest discovery)

**Total Sites**: 13 confirmed Chorus sites in the Proxima Sector
**Timeline**: First discovery 2385, systematic exploration 2387-2391
**Status**: 8 sites destroyed, 5 sites under corporate control

### Corporate Territory Division
**Stellarion**: Primary claims in Proxima, Wolf 359, Kepler-442
**Meridian Logistics**: Secondary claims in Tau Ceti, Ross 128
**Halcyon Industries**: Opportunistic acquisitions across region
**Independent Researchers**: Isolated discoveries, often bought out or eliminated

## Usage Guidelines

### In Narrative
- **First Reference**: Use full discovery designation: "Kepler-442c Site 7"
- **Academic Context**: Use cultural name: "The Harmonic Chambers"
- **Corporate Context**: Use asset code: "Asset K442-C7-R87"
- **Character Familiarity**: Marcus might know multiple names, others might know only one

### Character Knowledge
- **Marcus**: Knows discovery names and cultural names (worked with Reeves)
- **Detective Oriz**: Knows corporate asset codes from investigation
- **Dr. Chen**: Knows academic names from research literature
- **Trizik**: Knows Chorus indigenous names, some discovery names
- **Stellarion Executives**: Use asset codes exclusively

### Dialogue Examples
**Academic**: "Dr. Reeves discovered the Harmonic Chambers in 2387..."
**Corporate**: "We need to accelerate the K442-C7-R87 timeline..."
**Investigation**: "Asset records show Kepler-442c Site 7 was scheduled for demolition..."
**Cultural**: "The Chorus called it Vel'thari Nexus - the place of sound-learning."

## Impact on Existing Text

### Direct Replacements Needed
- "Gamma-12" → "Kepler-442c Site 7" or "The Harmonic Chambers"
- "Site Delta-9" → "Tau Ceti e Site 12" or "The Healing Confluence"
- "Site Beta-7" → "Wolf 359c Site 1" or "The Memory Palace"
- "Site Gamma-7" → "Ross 128b Site 9" or "The Temporal Observatory"

### Context-Appropriate Usage
**Chapter 5 (Dr. Sandoval's explanation)**: Use corporate asset codes to show business perspective
**Chapter 6 (Academic discussion)**: Use discovery designations and cultural names
**Chapter 7 (Investigation)**: Mix designation types based on speaker and context
**Chapter 8 (Evidence analysis)**: Corporate codes in financial records, cultural names in academic papers

## Consistency Rules

### Star System Selection
All systems are real star systems within reasonable range of human space exploration
- **No fictional systems** - maintains scientific credibility
- **Logical progression** - closer systems discovered first
- **Varied environments** - different planet types for different site characteristics

### Naming Evolution
Sites accumulate names over time:
1. **Discovery** (2385-2391): Official designation assigned
2. **Academic Study** (2387-2392): Cultural names develop based on research
3. **Corporate Acquisition** (2388-2392): Asset codes assigned for business tracking
4. **Cultural Integration** (Ongoing): Chorus names revealed through Trizik and other sources

### Documentation Standards
Each site entry should include:
- Discovery circumstances (who, when, how)
- Academic significance (what makes it important)
- Corporate value (why Stellarion wants it)
- Current status (active, destroyed, threatened)
- Cultural meaning (Chorus perspective if known)

## Quality Control

### Realism Checks
- [ ] Do naming patterns match real archaeological conventions?
- [ ] Are star systems astronomically accurate?
- [ ] Do timeline and travel distances make sense?
- [ ] Are cultural names appropriately alien but pronounceable?

### Consistency Verification
- [ ] Are all references to the same site using consistent names?
- [ ] Do corporate codes follow established format?
- [ ] Are discovery dates compatible with story timeline?
- [ ] Do character knowledge patterns match their backgrounds?

### Narrative Integration
- [ ] Do site names enhance rather than distract from story?
- [ ] Are multiple naming layers used appropriately?
- [ ] Does naming system support rather than complicate plot?
- [ ] Are names memorable without being gimmicky?
