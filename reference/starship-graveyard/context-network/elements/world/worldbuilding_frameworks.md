# Worldbuilding Frameworks

## Purpose
This document provides an overview and navigation hub for worldbuilding frameworks and principles. The detailed frameworks have been organized into specialized documents for better navigation and maintenance.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Worldbuilding
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Methodological
- **Confidence:** Initial Research

## Framework Categories

### Core Theory
- **[[frameworks/worldbuilding_principles]]** - Foundational Worldbuilding Principles
  - Consistency, Iceberg, Interconnection, Familiar-Strange Balance, Economy of Invention

### Construction Approaches
- **[[frameworks/structural_frameworks]]** - Systematic construction methods
  - GRAPES Framework, Historical Layering, Character-Centric, Cultural Development

- **[[frameworks/specialized_frameworks]]** - Domain-specific development approaches
  - Magic Systems, Technology Integration, Ecological, Religious, Economic, Linguistic

### Quality Assurance
- **[[frameworks/consistency_systems]]** - Methods for maintaining internal coherence
  - Consequence Mapping, Cultural-Environmental Feedback, Timeline Verification

### Practical Application
- **[[frameworks/implementation_tools]]** - Templates, questionnaires, and common pitfalls
  - Pitfall solutions, questionnaires, development templates

### Application Guidelines

#### Worldbuilding Project Process

1. **Conceptualization Phase**
   - Identify core world concepts and distinctive elements
   - Establish primary narrative requirements for the world
   - Select appropriate frameworks based on narrative needs
   - Define scope boundaries for immediate development

2. **Foundation Development Phase**
   - Apply structural frameworks to develop core world systems
   - Create preliminary maps and physical environment details
   - Establish fundamental rules (physical laws, magic systems, technologies)
   - Develop historical outline and major cultural groups

3. **Consistency Verification Phase**
   - Apply consistency systems to test world logic
   - Identify and resolve contradictions
   - Map consequences of major world elements
   - Verify timeline and developmental consistency

4. **Detail Expansion Phase**
   - Develop specific locations and environments
   - Create detailed cultural practices and belief systems
   - Flesh out historical events and their consequences
   - Apply specialized frameworks to develop specific world systems

5. **Integration Phase**
   - Connect world elements to narrative requirements
   - Develop character-world interactions
   - Create revelation strategies for world information
   - Prepare background materials and reference documents

## Navigation Guidance
- **Access Context:** Use this document when establishing worldbuilding approaches, evaluating worldbuilding consistency, or expanding world details
- **Common Next Steps:** After reviewing frameworks, proceed to applying selected frameworks to specific world elements
- **Related Tasks:** World development, culture creation, setting design, consistency checking
- **Update Patterns:** This document should be updated as new authoritative frameworks are identified through research
