# Reduced Scope Timeline - 13 Sites Over 7 Years

## Purpose
Replace the unbelievable "83 sites destroyed" with a realistic timeline of 13 sites over 7 years, showing how Stellarion's criminal enterprise evolved gradually from legitimate archaeology to systematic destruction.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Worldbuilding
- **Stability:** Reference
- **Abstraction:** Timeline
- **Confidence:** High

## Core Principle: Believable Criminal Evolution

### Scale Reduction Logic
**Old Scale**: 83 sites destroyed across "human space" - impossible to hide
**New Scale**: 13 sites across Proxima Sector - regional crime that could be covered up
**Timeline**: 2385-2392 (7 years) - allows for gradual corruption and escalation
**Impact**: Higher per-site significance, more believable institutional response

## The Stellarion Timeline: 2385-2392

### Phase 1: Legitimate Discovery (2385-2387)
**Corporate Status**: Newly formed archaeological research corporation
**Operations**: Genuine archaeological research, academic partnerships
**Sites Discovered**: 5 sites over 3 years
**Criminal Activity**: None - legitimate business operations

#### 2385: Foundation Year

- **Outcome**: Became Marcus and Reeves' most important discovery

**Ross 128b Site 9** (Independent Survey)
- **Academic Name**: "The Temporal Observatory"
- **Discovery**: Dr. Yuki Tanaka's independent research team
- **Significance**: Chorus time-measurement and astronomical instruments
- **Corporate Response**: Stellarion purchased access rights from Tanaka
- **Outcome**: First example of Stellarion acquiring existing discoveries

#### 2386: Expansion Year
**Proxima Centauri b Site 3** (Tanaka Survey Transfer)
- **Academic Name**: "The Spiral Archive"
- **Discovery**: Dr. Tanaka's team, rights sold to Stellarion for funding

**Criminal Activity**: First "accident," insurance fraud, authentication corruption

#### 2388: The First Destruction
**Wolf 359c Site 1 "Accident"** (May 2388)
- **Claimed Cause**: Structural instability during excavation
- **Real Cause**: Deliberate demolition after documentation
- **Insurance Claim**: 12 million credits for "lost research"

- **Academic Response**: Dr. Reeves begins investigation

**Kapteyn b Site 6** (Acquisition and Destruction)
- **Academic Name**: "The Neural Web"
- **Discovery**: University team, funding cut after Stellarion pressure
- **Timeline**: Acquired January, destroyed October 2390

#### 2391: Peak Criminal Operations
**Lacaille 9352 c Site 8** (Corporate Survey and Elimination)
- **Academic Name**: "The Resonance Library"
- **Timeline**: Discovered March, destroyed August 2391
- **Criminal Integration**: Site discovered specifically for client needs
- **Money Laundering**: 40 million credits for terrorist organization
- **Dr. Reeves**: Begins documenting pattern of destructions

**Ross 128b Site 9 "Accidental" Destruction** (November 2391)
- **Escalation**: Second destruction at same system as legitimate discovery
- **Cover Story**: Equipment malfunction during research
- **Real Cause**: Site contained evidence contradicting authentication fraud

- **Dr. Reeves**: Begins working with Trizik to document evidence

### Phase 4: Crisis and Exposure (2392)
**Corporate Status**: Criminal enterprise under investigation pressure
**Operations**: Desperate cover-up attempts, accelerated destructions
**Sites**: 3 sites under threat, investigation ongoing
**Criminal Activity**: Murder of Dr. Reeves, evidence destruction attempts

#### 2392: The Investigation Year
**Dr. Emil Reeves "Accident"** (March 2392)
- **Claimed Cause**: Industrial accident at independent research facility
- **Real Cause**: Murder for investigating systematic site destruction
- **Evidence**: Reeves had documented 8 site destructions and suspicious patterns
- **Response**: Academic community intimidated into silence
- **Kess Trizik**: Goes into hiding with preserved evidence

**Current Active Sites** (August 2392 - Present Story):
1. **Kepler-442c Site 7** (The Harmonic Chambers) - Under investigation
2. **Proxima Centauri b Site 3** (The Spiral Archive) - Scheduled for destruction
3. **Trappist-1e Site 11** (The Living Halls) - Recently discovered, preparation phase

## Criminal Enterprise Metrics

### Financial Progression
**2385-2387**: Legitimate research, $2.3 million in grants and investment
**2388-2389**: First fraud operations, $47 million in combined revenue/insurance
**2390-2391**: Peak criminal operations, $280 million in money laundering
**2392**: Crisis management, estimated $150 million in cover-up costs

### Site Destruction Pattern
**Total Sites Discovered**: 13 over 7 years (believable archaeological pace)
**Sites Destroyed**: 8 between 2388-2391 (escalating frequency)
**Sites Currently Active**: 3 under Stellarion control
**Sites Preserved**: 2 (independent research, outside corporate reach)

### Criminal Network Development
**2385-2387**: Academic partnerships, legitimate business relationships
**2388-2389**: First criminal clients, corruption of authentication boards
**2390-2391**: Organized crime partnerships, systematic institutional corruption
**2392**: Desperate criminal alliance, political corruption, murder operations

## Believability Factors

### Archaeological Realism
**Discovery Rate**: 13 sites over 7 years = 1.9 sites/year across 5 star systems
**Geographic Distribution**: Concentrated in accessible systems with minimal oversight
**Research Timeline**: 2-3 years from discovery to destruction allows proper documentation
**Academic Response**: Gradual recognition of pattern over 4 years matches institutional sluggishness

### Corporate Evolution
**Legitimate Start**: Company founded for actual archaeological research
**Gradual Corruption**: Financial pressures lead to first compromises
**Criminal Acceleration**: Success breeds larger criminal partnerships
**Institutional Capture**: Systematic corruption develops over years, not months

### Law Enforcement Reality
**Initial Blindness**: First "accidents" accepted as legitimate industrial hazards
**Pattern Recognition**: Takes 3-4 incidents before investigation begins
**Institutional Resistance**: Corporate influence delays proper investigation
**Cross-Jurisdiction**: Regional scope creates realistic law enforcement challenges

## Story Impact

### Higher Per-Site Stakes
**Each Site Matters**: 13 sites means each destruction is significant archaeological loss
**Personal Connections**: Marcus and Reeves connected to multiple sites personally
**Academic Community**: Small enough that everyone knows everyone
**Regional Impact**: Proxima Sector archaeological community devastated by losses

### Believable Investigation
**Evidence Scope**: 8 destroyed sites generate manageable investigation scope
**Witness Network**: Small community means overlapping relationships
**Document Trail**: 7-year operation generates substantial but traceable evidence
**Criminal Response**: Reasonable chance of cover-up success with regional scope

### Character Relationships
**Marcus-Reeves Connection**: Discovered first site together, witnessed entire evolution
**Academic Community**: Everyone affected by systematic destruction of regional sites
**Corporate Employees**: Some hired during legitimate phase, corrupted gradually
**Investigators**: Regional scope allows small team to make meaningful impact

## Usage in Revisions

### Chapter References to Update
**Chapter 5**: Change "83 sites" to "8 sites destroyed over 4 years"
**Chapter 7**: Kepler-442c Site 7 is one of 13 total discoveries, not hundreds
**Chapter 8**: Evidence spans 7-year criminal evolution, not impossible galactic conspiracy
**Trizik References**: Has evidence from 8 destroyed sites, not 83

### Character Knowledge Updates
**Marcus**: Personally connected to first discovery, witnessed entire timeline
**Dr. Reeves**: Investigated 4-year pattern before murder  
**Trizik**: Documented 8 destructions, has samples from each
**Detective Oriz**: Investigating regional criminal enterprise, not galactic conspiracy
**Dr. Tanaka**: Early researcher who sold rights to Stellarion, now regrets enabling their expansion

### Corporate Timeline Integration
**Stellarion Evolution**: 7-year transformation from legitimate to criminal
**Criminal Network**: Gradual development of organized crime partnerships
