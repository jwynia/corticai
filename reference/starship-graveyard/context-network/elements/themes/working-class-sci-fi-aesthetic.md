# Working-Class Science Fiction Aesthetic

## Purpose
Defines the blue-collar, working-class aesthetic that permeates the Starship Graveyard narrative.

## Core Elements

### Visual and Sensory
- Grease-stained coveralls and practical work clothes
- Industrial sounds: welding, machinery, metal on metal
- Smells of machine oil, hot metal, recycled air
- Worn but functional equipment
- Improvised repairs and modifications

### Language and Dialogue
- Direct, unpretentious speech patterns
- Technical jargon mixed with everyday language
- Humor as coping mechanism
- Practical problem-solving discussions
- No mystical or overly philosophical tangents

### Technology Approach
- Tools that look used and maintained
- Nothing pristine or purely aesthetic
- Function over form in all designs
- Visible wear, repairs, modifications
- Technology as tools, not magic

### Thematic Elements
- Work as identity and dignity
- Small business vs corporate power
- Community bonds through shared struggle
- Practical skills valued over credentials
- Financial pressure as constant reality

## Implementation in Starship Graveyard
- Marcus's salvage yard setting
- Tot breakfast and comfort food
- Shipping container home with DIY observation deck
