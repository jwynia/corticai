# Character Naming Principles

## Purpose
Foundational principles for effective character naming, focusing on phonological significance and cultural coherence.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Character Development
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Abstraction:** Methodological
- **Confidence:** Established

## Phonological Significance Principle

This principle recognizes that the sound patterns (phonology) of names carry implicit meanings that can reinforce or contradict character traits. Research in sound symbolism consistently shows that certain sounds evoke specific impressions across cultures.

### Key Aspects
- **Plosive consonants** (b, d, g, p, t, k): evoke hardness, decisiveness, and strength
- **Fricatives and sibilants** (f, v, s, z, sh): evoke softness, subtlety, or deceptiveness
- **Front vowels** (e, i): suggest smallness, quickness, or sharpness
- **Back vowels** (o, u): suggest largeness, slowness, or roundness
- **Name length** affects perception of formality and social position

### Application
- Match sound patterns to character personality traits
- Use contradictory patterns to create interesting tension
- Test names by reading aloud to assess phonological impact

## Cultural Coherence Principle

This principle emphasizes that names must align with their cultural context, whether real-world or fictional, to maintain narrative believability.

### Key Aspects
- Names reflect specific cultural origins and time periods
- Naming conventions follow consistent patterns within cultures
- Names evolve over time within cultures (historical naming trends)
- Names carry embedded cultural markers (religious references, family connections)
- Cross-cultural names often follow specific adaptation patterns

### Application
- Research historical and cultural naming patterns
- Develop consistent naming conventions for fictional cultures
- Consider character's family history and cultural identity
- Respect cultural significance of naming traditions

## Association and Meaning

Names carry multiple layers of meaning that can enhance character depth:

1. **Etymological meaning**: Historical origins and literal meanings
2. **Cultural associations**: What the name suggests within its culture
3. **Literary associations**: Previous uses in literature/media
4. **Personal associations**: Reader's individual connections
5. **Narrative function**: How the name serves the story

## Quick Checklist

Before finalizing a character name:
- [ ] Does the sound match the character's personality?
- [ ] Is it culturally appropriate to the setting?
- [ ] Are there unintended associations?
- [ ] Is it pronounceable by target audience?
- [ ] Does it stand out from other character names?
