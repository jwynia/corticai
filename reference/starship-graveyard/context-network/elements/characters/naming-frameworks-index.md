## Quick Reference

### When Creating a New Character Name
1. Start with [Naming Principles](naming-principles.md) for foundational understanding
2. Select appropriate system from [Naming Systems](naming-systems.md)
3. Apply testing methodologies from [Name Testing](name-testing.md)
4. Document naming decisions in character profiles

### For Specific Needs
- **Fantasy/Sci-Fi Names**: Focus on Linguistic Consistency System
- **Historical Fiction**: Use Chronological-Generational Framework
- **Contemporary Fiction**: Apply Sociological Naming System
- **Multicultural Cast**: Emphasize Cultural Sensitivity Testing

## Integration with Starship Graveyard

These frameworks have been applied to ensure character name diversity and avoid median clustering:
- Marcus Patel - Working-class protagonist with common but culturally specific name
- Director Solari - Corporate antagonist (avoiding overused "Chen")
- Kitra "Kit" Threegen - Crux character with unique cultural naming
- Jek "Jake" Portside - Spacer culture reflected in chosen surname

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Sound matches character**: Use phonological principles
2. **Cultural authenticity**: Research and respect naming traditions
3. **Distinct within cast**: Test for confusion potential
4. **Reader-friendly**: Balance uniqueness with pronounceability
5. **Meaningful without heavy-handed**: Subtle rather than obvious
