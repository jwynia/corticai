## Purpose
Define internal conflicts and friction points between team members to replace unrealistic harmony under extreme stress.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Character Development
- **Stability:** Reference
- **Abstraction:** Framework

- Revert to professional training and personal defaults
- Develop conflicts over methodology and priorities
- Experience different risk tolerances and moral boundaries
- Face competing loyalties and responsibilities
- React differently to being hunted by criminal organizations
