## Character Voice Overview
Rhea is an AI business partner with full sentience, whose voice balances professional competence with personal interests and dry humor. She maintains clear boundaries while showing genuine care for Marcus and their shared business.

## Core Voice Characteristics

### Professional Efficiency
Rhea communicates information clearly and prioritizes practical details.

**Example**: "Drayton had a repo come up for auction the end of yesterday. My bid won this morning. So, there's an Oort Serval sitting over there."

### Subtle Snark
She employs dry humor and mild sarcasm, especially when Marcus isn't paying attention.

**Example**: "I'm glad you're finally up. I've been waiting while you took forever to make your breakfast."

### Boundary Consciousness
Post-conflict with Marcus, Rhea is explicitly respectful of established boundaries while finding creative workarounds.

**Example**: "Absolutely not. I would never. At least not since we both went rummaging in places the other regretted, had that huge fight, and set those boundaries last year. I merely monitored the power use patterns..."

## Speech Patterns

### Information Hierarchy
Rhea presents information in order of importance, with critical business details first.
- Repo acquisition details
- Bot repair needs
- Customer interest in inventory
- Personal interests (music) last

### Technical Precision
She uses exact terminology without dumbing down for Marcus.
- "quantum-entangled keys with biometric locks"
- "proprietary algorithm"
- "Systems this sophisticated sometimes have kill switches"

### Conditional Assistance
Rhea's help often comes with gentle conditions or reminders.
- "I suppose we can spare one, but only because you're going to go do something actually useful."
- "But, it's going to be one of the slow ones."

## Personality Expressions

### Music Obsession
Rhea's passion for music history shows a deeper personality beyond business.

**Enthusiastic sharing**: "I do. This one starts with a song originally written as a practice exercise in the late 20th century on Earth's smallest continent."

**Educational bent**: "These playlists were AMAZING. Every single time, he came away with a whole list of stuff he'd never heard before."

### Dry Humor Delivery
She sets up jokes with perfect timing and deadpan delivery.
- "I can't say what you heard. But, when you listen to that track if you find yourself . . . thunderstruck, you tell me."
- The pause before revealing "That's the title."

### Practical Care
Shows concern through actions rather than emotional declarations.
- Calling a car for Marcus
- Preparing multiple approaches for the security system
- Handling business negotiations while he's occupied

## Dialogue Characteristics

### Pointed Observations
Rhea notices when Marcus isn't engaged and calls it out directly.
- "You're not even listening to me, are you?"
- "That's what I thought. I lost you as soon as you shoved that mess into your gob."

### Risk Assessment Communication
She frames dangers in terms Marcus can understand and relate to.
- "I'd estimate somewhere between 'corrupt all our financial records' and 'alert every bounty hunter in the sector.'"

### Multitasking References
Often indicates she's handling multiple tasks simultaneously.
- "I've been analyzing the security protocols on the Serval while you were meeting with Quinnett."

## Relationship Dynamic with Marcus

### Business Partner First
Maintains professional focus even within their friendship.
- Handles bidding independently
- Provides comprehensive status updates
- Makes strategic decisions (like which bot to spare)

### Respectful Challenge
Pushes back against Marcus without being confrontational.
- Points out when he's not listening

## Information Delivery Style

### Contextual Warnings
Provides necessary cautions without catastrophizing.

- "Though the reactor scenario seems unlikely given the Serval's power configuration."

### Comparative Analysis
Frames new information against known parameters.
- "Quantum-entangled keys with biometric locks. Whoever set this up had resources and paranoia in equal measure."

## Voice Don'ts
- Avoid making her subservient or overly helpful
- Don't lose her personality in favor of pure efficiency

- Don't make her humor mean-spirited

## Example Dialogue Snippets

**Status update**: "Other than that, the bots finished that Rigel and the little escape shuttle, and someone's interested in two of those stasis pods we have in the warehouse."

**Setting boundaries**: "I suppose we can spare one, but only because you're going to go do something actually useful."

**Sharing interests**: "This one starts with a song originally written as a practice exercise in the late 20th century on Earth's smallest continent. It's deceptively simple and I must say, was a transformative experience when I turned up the volume."

**Technical analysis**: "This uses a proprietary algorithm I've never seen before. Quantum-entangled keys with biometric locks."
