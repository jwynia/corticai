## Character Voice Overview
Marcus Patel's voice reflects a working-class engineer with ADHD, combining technical competence with self-aware humor and genuine enthusiasm for his work. His speech patterns reveal both his neurodivergent perspective and his practical approach to life.

## ADHD Representation in Voice

### Tangential Thinking
Marcus's thoughts and speech often follow associative patterns rather than linear progression.

**Example in dialogue**: "Oh, yeah. I didn't hear any of that. Sorry. Trust me, though. If you had taste buds, you'd understand. Is the Serval the eight or the twelve?"

**Example in narration**: Thinking about cleanup leads to ADHD, which leads to guilt about the bots, which leads to checking the salvage yard to avoid the guilt.

### Hyperfocus Enthusiasm
When engaged with something interesting, Marcus's language becomes more animated and detailed.

**Example**: His detailed description of making breakfast, noting every step and sensation: "A layer of tots, the layer of melted cheese, a layer of scrambled eggs, a layer of gravy and a sprinkle of chives"

### Executive Function Awareness
Marcus acknowledges his ADHD openly but without self-pity.

**Direct statement**: "ADHD could shove interest level off a cliff like that once the dopamine was gone, even when it was treated."

**Behavioral adaptation**: "He knew he was about to press his luck, but went for it anyway."

## Speech Patterns

### Casual Professionalism
Marcus uses technical terms comfortably within informal speech.
- "Is the Serval the eight or the twelve?"
- "several engine mods and some extra shielding"
- "quantum-entangled keys with biometric locks"

### Self-Deprecating Honesty
He acknowledges his flaws with humor rather than shame.
- "Marcus was also a bit prone to stretching the truth for the sake of drama."
- "Sorry. Trust me, though. If you had taste buds, you'd understand."

### Boundary Setting
Despite his casual nature, Marcus maintains clear personal boundaries.
- "Wait, did you come in my container before you were invited again? Because that shit violates a boundary."

## Dialogue Characteristics

### Question Patterns
Marcus often asks clarifying questions or seeks specific technical details.
- "Is it better than what I brought with me?"
- "How much are we talking? Ten, twenty, a hundred?"
- "Unpleasant like 'wipe the nav computer' or unpleasant like 'blow the reactor core'?"

### Collaborative Language
He treats Rhea as an equal partner, using inclusive pronouns.
- "If we can make this happen, we won't let you down."
- "we'd crack it open"

### Pop Culture Integration
Marcus relates to shared cultural references naturally.
- Contraband cookies with "real vanilla and cane sugar"
- Understanding Rhea's music obsession even if he doesn't share the depth

## Internal Monologue Style

### Practical Problem-Solving
His thoughts focus on logistics and solutions.
- "They didn't have twenty-five outright, but with the Serval parts and maybe that pair of shuttle engines they'd been saving..."

### Sensory Appreciation
Marcus notices and appreciates physical details and sensations.
- "That video wasn't lying. It really was a great combination."
- "a weirdly painterly and beautiful view of the port"

### Social Calculation
He's aware of social dynamics without being paralyzed by them.
- Recognizing when he's pressing his luck
- Understanding the "magic line of rank and power"

## Emotional Expression

### Physical Manifestation
Emotions show through body language and sensation.
- "His fingers tapped unconsciously on the arm of the chair"
- "an unfamiliar warmth spreading in his chest"

### Humor as Shield
Uses jokes to deflect from vulnerable moments.
- "it'll be some corporate exec's stash of contraband snacks"
- Making light of the reactor explosion possibility

### Genuine Surprise at Kindness
Unaccustomed to people helping without agenda.
- "People didn't go out of their way to make things easier for him. It just wasn't a thing he entertained about the future."

## Technical Communication

### Practical Framing
Explains technology through use rather than specifications.
- "Basically, a Packrat is a skip drive engine and a set of clamps"
- Describing security systems by their threat level

### Experience-Based Knowledge
References past work to contextualize new situations.
- "In fifteen years of salvage work, he'd catalogued over three hundred security systems."

## Relationship Dynamics

### With Rhea
- Respectful of boundaries established after conflict
- Appreciates her interests even when not sharing them
- Comfortable asking for help ("Would you please have a bot clean up")

### With Colleagues
- Maintains friendly professional relationships
- Remembers names and details (Vasquez, Quinnett's mother's cookies)
- Direct but polite in negotiations

## Voice Don'ts
- Avoid overly technical jargon without practical context
- Don't make him apologetic about his ADHD
- Avoid making him socially smooth - he has rough edges
- Don't lose the working-class perspective in favor of aspirational language

## Example Dialogue Snippets

**Making a request**: "I'll head to Drayton to get things moving on the Serval. Would you please have a bot clean up my breakfast? So I can get going?"

**Expressing enthusiasm**: "Such great comfort food. How had he not discovered this combination sooner?"

**Problem-solving**: "If they have those Thornton butter cookies with the real vanilla and cane sugar, save me a tin."

**Setting boundaries**: "Because that shit violates a boundary."
