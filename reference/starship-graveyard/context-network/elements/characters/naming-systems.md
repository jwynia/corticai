# Character Naming Systems

## Purpose
Structured frameworks for creating consistent and meaningful character names across different narrative contexts.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Character Development
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Methodological
- **Confidence:** Established

## Multidimensional Naming System

A comprehensive framework based on five key dimensions for creating meaningful names.

### Five Naming Dimensions
1. **Phonology:** Sound patterns and their psychological impact
2. **Etymology:** Historical origins and literal meanings
3. **Cultural Context:** Background, heritage, and social markers
4. **Narrative Function:** How the name serves story purposes
5. **Association Mapping:** Connection to recognizable patterns, people, or archetypes

### Application Process
1. Identify three key character traits or themes for reinforcement
2. Select sound patterns that evoke these traits
3. Research etymological meanings that connect to character
4. Consider cultural background appropriate to setting
5. Test name against character role and narrative function

## Sociological Naming System

A framework for creating realistic naming patterns across character groups, ensuring names reflect social structures and relationships.

### Sociological Dimensions
1. **Family Relationships:** How names reflect lineage and family connections
2. **Social Class Markers:** How naming patterns signal social position
3. **Regional Variations:** How geography influences naming traditions
4. **Religious Influences:** How belief systems affect naming practices
5. **Professional Identifiers:** How occupation influences naming (epithets, titles)

### Application Process
1. Develop distinct naming patterns for different social groups
2. Create family naming traditions for major character groups
3. Establish regional naming variations within the setting
4. Define how religious or philosophical systems influence names
5. Consider how professions and social roles affect naming

## Linguistic Consistency System

A methodology for creating consistent fictional naming languages that avoid common linguistic inconsistencies.

### Linguistic Dimensions
1. **Phoneme Inventory:** Specific sounds used in the language
2. **Syllable Structure:** Rules for how sounds combine
3. **Morphology:** Rules for word formation and modification
4. **Orthography:** How sounds are represented in writing
5. **Naming Patterns:** Conventions for specific name types

### Application Process
1. Define specific consonants and vowels used in the language
2. Establish rules for acceptable syllable patterns
3. Create specific patterns for different name types (given names, family names)
4. Develop consistent spelling conventions
5. Test new names against established linguistic rules

## Chronological-Generational Framework

A system for creating realistic generational variations in names, particularly useful for family sagas and historical narratives.

### Generational Dimensions
1. **Time-Period Markers:** Names typical of specific historical periods
2. **Traditional-to-Innovative Spectrum:** How naming conservatism varies across generations
3. **Commemorative Patterns:** How names honor ancestors or historical figures
4. **Nickname Evolution:** How informal names change across generations
5. **Cross-Cultural Influence:** How cultural contact affects naming across time

### Application Process
1. Research historical naming trends for relevant periods
2. Develop family-specific naming traditions
3. Create generational patterns (every third son named after grandfather)
4. Establish nickname patterns appropriate to each generation
5. Map cultural influences on naming across the timeline
