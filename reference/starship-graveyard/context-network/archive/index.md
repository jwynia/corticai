# Archive - Navigation Hub

## Purpose
Central navigation for archived project materials, including superseded planning documents, completed research, and historical project states.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Historical Records
- **Stability:** Static
- **Abstraction:** Navigation
- **Confidence:** High

## Archive Categories

### Memory Bank
Historical project state from earlier development phases.

- [[memory-bank/activeScene]] - Previous scene tracking
- [[memory-bank/characters]] - Earlier character development
- [[memory-bank/plotStructure]] - Original plot structure
- [[memory-bank/progress]] - Historical progress tracking
- [[memory-bank/settings]] - Initial setting details
- [[memory-bank/worldbuilding]] - Early worldbuilding notes

**Note:** Memory bank files represent an earlier project state before the current context network system. They're preserved for reference but may not reflect current project direction.

### Research Tasks
Completed research summaries that informed current frameworks.

- [[research_tasks/cross_cultural_storytelling_research_summary]] - Cross-cultural narrative research
- [[research_tasks/digital_era_narrative_conventions_research_summary]] - Digital storytelling research
- [[research_tasks/environmental_design_research_summary]] - Setting and environment research
- [[research_tasks/genre_specific_plot_research_summary]] - Genre convention research
- [[research_tasks/interactive_narrative_research_summary]] - Interactive storytelling research
- [[research_tasks/visual_storytelling_research_summary]] - Visual narrative research

**Note:** These research summaries have been incorporated into the main framework documents in `/elements/plot/`.

## Archive Usage Guidelines

### When to Access Archive
- Checking project history
- Understanding evolution of ideas
- Recovering abandoned concepts
- Research verification
- Historical comparison

### When NOT to Use Archive
- Current planning needs
- Active development reference
- Up-to-date information
- Current project state

### Archive vs Active Documents
**Archive Contains:**
- Superseded plans
- Historical snapshots
- Completed research
- Abandoned approaches

**Active Locations:**
- `/planning/` - Current plans
- `/elements/` - Live frameworks
- `/discovery/` - Active findings
- Root navigation - Current state

## Historical Context

### Memory Bank Era
- Pre-context network system
- Less structured organization
- Individual file tracking
- Limited cross-referencing

### Research Phase
- Systematic investigation
- Framework development
- Best practice compilation
- Integration into elements

### Current System
- Context network structure
- Atomic note organization
- Extensive cross-linking
- Discovery tracking

## Important Notes

### Superseded Information
Many archive documents contain information that has been:
- Revised significantly
- Replaced with new approaches
- Contradicted by later decisions
- Integrated into current frameworks

Always verify against current documents before using archived information.

### Research Integration
The research summaries in this archive have been:
- Expanded into full frameworks
- Split into atomic documents
- Enhanced with examples
- Updated with new findings

For current frameworks, see `/elements/plot/` subdirectories.

### Version History
Archive provides historical record but not version control:
- Shows major phases only
- Not comprehensive history
- Key snapshots preserved
- Daily changes not tracked

## Navigation Guidance

### Finding Historical Information
1. Check archive index first
2. Note the context/date
3. Compare with current docs
4. Use for reference only

### Research to Framework Mapping
- Cross-cultural research → [cross-cultural storytelling frameworks](../elements/plot/cross-cultural/index.md)
- Genre research → [genre-specific frameworks](../elements/plot/genre-specific/index.md)
- Digital era research → [[../elements/plot/digital_era_narrative_frameworks]]
- Interactive research → [[../elements/plot/interactive_narrative_frameworks]]

## Maintenance Policy

### What Gets Archived
- Completed project phases
- Superseded planning docs
- Finished research tasks
- Major version snapshots

### Archive Organization
- Maintain folder structure
- Preserve original names
- Add context notes
- Keep README files

### No Active Editing
- Archive is read-only
- Don't update archived files
- Create new docs instead
- Note supersession clearly
