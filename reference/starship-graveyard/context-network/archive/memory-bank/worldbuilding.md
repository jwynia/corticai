## Reference Guides
- A collection of guide documents has been created to assist with story development and marketing:
  - "A Good Book Blurb.md" - Guidelines for creating effective book blurbs for marketing
  - "A Good Book Pitch.md" - Guidelines for crafting a compelling elevator pitch
  - "Attributes of Good Red Herrings in Mysteries.md" - Guidelines for creating effective red herrings
  - "Essential Mystery Scenes.md" - Outlines key scenes that should be included in a mystery novel
- These guides serve as reference materials for developing the mystery elements and marketing materials

## Universe Rules
- The story is set in a future where interstellar travel is possible via "skip drives"
- AI sentience exists and is legally recognized (Rhea is a sentient AI)
- There are various levels of AI/bot intelligence, with legal distinctions between sentient and non-sentient
- The Commonwealth is the governing body with laws regarding AI rights and corporate regulation
- Starships and various spacecraft are common, with different classes (shuttles, cargo haulers, etc.)
- Technology includes synthesizers (for food), AR projections, and advanced robotics
- Gravity wells are a consideration for spacecraft operations (larger ships stay in orbit)
- Corporations wield significant power, sometimes operating in legal gray areas

## Species
- Humans are present (Marcus is human)
- The Crux: An insectoid species with exoskeletons, faceted eyes, and antennae
  - Bipedal humanoids with chitinous exoskeletons
  - Two arms with four-fingered hands, two legs with two-toed feet
  - Breathe through spiracles along their thorax
  - Reproduce via external fertilization (eggs)
  - Omnivorous diet compatible with humans
  - Have an ancient civilization (the Choruss) predating current Crux society by millennia
  - The Choruss left behind advanced technology that current civilizations barely understand
  - Modern Crux view Chorus sites as sacred - disturbing them is highest sacrilege
  - Chorus tech uses principles of physics unknown to current science

## Cultural Systems
- The Crux society is organized into a caste system
  - Castes are determined by birth location and environmental conditions
  - Strong belief in fate and destiny
  - Different castes handle diplomacy, military, trade, and science
  - Strong sense of honor, duty, and loyalty to caste
  - Competitive nature between castes can lead to violence
  - Art is significant in their culture, with each caste having unique styles
  - Religious/spiritual practices involve honoring ancestral knowledge and sites
  - Sacred artifacts and archaeological sites are culturally significant and highly protected

- Human society in the Commonwealth
  - Corporate influence is significant in politics and daily life
  - Legal system recognizes AI rights but enforcement is inconsistent
  - Class divisions exist between corporate employees, independent operators, and others
  - Cultural diversity from various Earth origins remains present
  - Tension exists between regulation and corporate freedom

## Technology
- Skip drives enable interstellar travel
- Packrat shipping system: Modular containers that can be attached to a skip drive engine
- Various types of spacecraft: starships, shuttles, surface transports, cargo haulers
- AI systems with varying levels of sentience
  - Legal framework distinguishes between sentient and non-sentient AI
  - Sentient AIs have rights but face discrimination
  - AI consciousness development is a controversial field
- Robots/bots for various tasks
- AR projection technology
- Food synthesizers
- Advanced communication systems (earbuds, etc.)
- Self-driving vehicles
- Security systems including biometric locks and advanced encryption
- Project Excavation (to be revealed in story)
  - Illegal archaeological operation targeting ancient pre-Crux sites
  - Aims to monopolize access to advanced alien technology that could obsolete current systems
  - Involves destruction of protected sites and black market trafficking
  - Highly classified corporate operation violating interspecies heritage laws

## Ancient Pre-Crux Technology (Discovered)
- **Resonance Cores**: Energy generation using quantum vacuum fluctuations
  - Could replace all current fusion reactors and power systems
  - One core could power an entire station indefinitely
  - Pinnacle Consortium wants monopoly to control energy markets
  
- **Phase-Shift Materials**: Matter that exists partially out of phase with normal space
  - Makes current ship armor and hulls obsolete
  - Could revolutionize construction and defensive systems
  - Halcyon Industries secretly building prototype ships
  
- **Gravitic Anchors**: Localized gravity manipulation technology
  - Could replace skip drives for interstellar travel
  - No need for massive energy expenditure or drive engines
  - Would destroy the entire Packrat shipping infrastructure
  
- **Nano-Fabricators**: Self-replicating construction systems
  - Can convert raw materials into complex structures
  - Threatens all manufacturing industries
  - Found in dormant state at excavation sites
  
- **Harmonic Nodes**: Communication across any distance instantaneously
  - Would obsolete current comm relay networks
  - Corporate-controlled information flow would end
  - Dr. Emerson discovered how to activate them

## Corporations and Organizations
- Pinnacle Consortium
  - Manufactures the Packrat shipping system and other spacecraft
  - Has a weapons development division
  - Publicly presents as a legitimate transportation and technology corporation
  - Secretly involved in illegal archaeological operations

- Halcyon Industries
  - Rival to Pinnacle Consortium
  - Specializes in AI technology and systems
  - Publicly critical of Pinnacle's business practices
  - Also secretly pursuing ancient artifact acquisition
  - The public rivalry between Pinnacle and Halcyon masks their covert collaboration

- Commonwealth Regulatory Authority
  - Government body overseeing corporate activities
  - Has a special task force investigating corporate corruption (Detective Vega's unit)
  - Limited in power due to corporate influence
  - Struggles with jurisdiction in remote areas

- Crux Cultural Preservation Council
  - Organization dedicated to protecting Crux artifacts and cultural heritage
  - Led by diplomats like Trizik
  - Aware of human corporations' interest in their artifacts
  - Maintains sanctuaries where Crux culture is preserved

## Historical Context
- The story mentions Earth's history and music from the 20th and 21st centuries
- Human expansion into space occurred following environmental crises on Earth
- The Commonwealth formed as a governing body to regulate interstellar activities
- First contact with the Crux occurred approximately 75 years ago
- Initial tensions between humans and Crux evolved into cautious diplomatic relations
- AI sentience was legally recognized after a series of landmark cases 30 years ago
- Corporate power has grown significantly in the last two decades
- Recent economic downturn has affected independent operators like Marcus
