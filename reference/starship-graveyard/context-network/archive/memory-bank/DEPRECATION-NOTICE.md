# Memory Bank Deprecation Notice

## Status: DEPRECATED

This entire `memory-bank/` directory contains files from an older documentation system that has been superseded by the current context network structure.

## Migration Mapping

All content from these files has been migrated to the following locations:

- **activeScene.md** → `planning/current_status.md`
- **characters.md** → `elements/characters/overview.md`
- **plotStructure.md** → `elements/plot/overview.md`
- **progress.md** → `planning/current_status.md`
- **settings.md** → `elements/settings/overview.md`
- **worldbuilding.md** → `elements/world/overview.md`

## Important

- **DO NOT UPDATE** any files in this directory
- **DO NOT REFERENCE** these files for current information
- These files are preserved for historical reference only
- All updates should be made to the current locations listed above

## Why These Files Exist

These files represent the project state before the context network migration completed on 2025-06-27. They are retained to:
1. Provide historical context
2. Allow verification of successful migration
3. Serve as reference for the evolution of the documentation system

## For Current Information

Always use the main context network structure starting from:
- `discovery.md` - Navigation guide
- `index.md` - Project overview
- `elements/` - Current project elements
- `planning/` - Active planning documents
