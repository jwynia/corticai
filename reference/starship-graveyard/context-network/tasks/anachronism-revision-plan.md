# Anachronism Revision Plan

## Task Overview
Systematic revision of Earth-centric anachronisms to create a more authentic galactic civilization setting.

## Priority Order (Impact vs Effort)

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)

#### 1. Coffee → Caff (with Marcus Exception)
- **General Replace**: Most "coffee" references → "caff" (synthetic caffeine beverage)
- **Marcus Exception**: Keep Marcus drinking real coffee as character trait
- **Implementation**: 
  - Others offer/drink "caff"
  - Marcus specifically asks for/brings real coffee
  - Characters comment on his old-fashioned preference
  - Makes coffee rare/expensive/special
- **Chapters**: 4, 30, 38
- **Character Note**: Reinforces Marcus as someone who values authenticity/tradition

#### 2. Phone → Comm
- **Replace**: "phone," "phone call," "burner phone"
- **With**: "comm," "comm unit," "disposable comm"
- **Chapters**: 20, 24, 30, 34
- **Note**: Simple find/replace with context check

#### 3. Kilometers → Klicks
- **Replace**: "kilometers," "miles"
- **With**: "klicks" (military-style) or "spans" (new unit)
- **Chapters**: 10, 14, 34
- **Note**: Already somewhat futuristic

### Phase 2: Moderate Changes (Medium Impact, Medium Effort)

#### 4. Earth-Specific Foods
- **Chapter 1**: "sausage gravy, cheese curds, tots" → "protein mash, synth-curds, crispy carb-bits"
- **Beer/Wine**: → "fermented grain drink," "vintage synthohol"
- **Note**: Keep familiar concepts but make them space-appropriate

#### 5. Vehicle Names
- **Replace**: "truck," "van"
- **With**: "hauler," "transport," "groundcar"
- **Chapters**: 21, 30
- **Note**: Simple but numerous replacements

### Phase 3: Complex Revisions (High Impact, High Effort)

#### 6. Cultural References
- **Wedding rings**: → "bond-marks," "union symbols," or species-specific customs
- **Church reference**: → "meditation chamber" or "archive hall"
- **Birthday dinners**: → "cycle celebrations" or "orbit-day"

#### 7. Historical References
- **Chapter 1, line 66**: Remove specific Earth timeline reference
- **Chapter 8, line 119**: Make wood panels from "preserved colony-world forests"
- **Note**: Requires rewriting for context

#### 8. Fashion Updates
- **Suits/ties**: → "formal wear," "business attire," "diplomatic dress"
- **Leather jacket**: → "protective jacket," "weathered shipsuit"
- **Note**: Keep function but update terminology

### Phase 4: Language Evolution

#### 9. Profanity/Slang
- Create space-specific curses: "void it," "space it," "burn my drives"
- Replace "OK" with "acknowledged," "confirmed," or "copy"
- Develop unique idioms for space culture

#### 10. Corporate Terminology
- "Quarterly earnings" → "cycle reports"
- "Insurance" → "risk coverage," "liability bonds"
- Update business language to reflect interstellar commerce

## Implementation Strategy

### Week 1: Phases 1 & 2
- Global find/replace for simple terms
- Context verification for each change
- Test readability

### Week 2: Phase 3
- Rewrite cultural references
- Develop consistent replacements
- Create terminology guide

### Week 3: Phase 4
- Language polish
- Consistency check
- Reader feedback

## Terminology Guide (To Be Developed)

### Beverages
- Coffee → Caff (for most people)
- Real coffee → Rare/expensive, Marcus's preference
- Beer → Brew/Ferment
- Wine → Vintage
- Tea → Synthetic tea (most common) vs real tea (rare)

### Technology
- Phone → Comm
- Computer → Terminal/System
- Truck → Hauler

### Measurements
- Kilometer → Klick/Span
- Hour → Cycle
- Year → Orbit/Turn

### Cultural
- Wedding → Bonding/Union
- Birthday → Cycle-day
- Church → Archive/Meditation hall

## Success Metrics
- No Earth-specific dates or places
- Technology feels evolved
- Culture feels galactic, not Earth-centric
- Language reflects space-faring civilization
