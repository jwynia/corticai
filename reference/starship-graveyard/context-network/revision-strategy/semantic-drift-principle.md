# Semantic Drift Revision Principle

## The Key Insight
Terms persist but meanings expand. "Coffee" means any roasted/brewed stimulant. "Beer" means any fermented grain beverage. The preparation method defines the category, not the Earth-specific ingredient.

## Why This Works
- Natural language evolution (already happens on Earth)
- Avoids clunky sci-fi neologisms
- Readers understand immediately
- Creates rich worldbuilding opportunities

## Revision Approach

### KEEP the familiar terms:
- Coffee, tea, beer, wine, whiskey
- Meat, cheese, bread, milk
- Breakfast, lunch, dinner

### SHOW the evolution through:
- Quality descriptions ("the coffee was bitter but did the job")
- Price differences (real vs synthetic)
- Character preferences (Marcus's real coffee)
- Origin markers ("Tau Station coffee," "Earth whiskey")

### AVOID over-explaining:
❌ "The beer, made from fermented Centauri grain..."
✓ "The beer tasted off - probably that cheap colony stuff"

## Quick Examples

### Coffee Scene
**Original worry**: "Coffee is too Earth-centric"
**Better approach**: 
- Most people drink various "coffees" (roasted stimulant beverages)
- Marcus specifically seeks "real coffee" (Earth beans)
- Shows character through preference

### Beer Reference
**Original**: "Beer that tasted like recycled water and barley"
**Understanding**: 
- "Beer" = any fermented grain drink
- "Barley" might be habit, nostalgia, or specific variety
- The bad taste is the focus, not the Earth connection

### Restaurant Scene
**Instead of**: Inventing alien foods
**Better**: "The breakfast menu promised 'real eggs' for triple price"

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Keep familiar food/drink terms
- [ ] Add origin/quality markers where relevant
- [ ] Show synthetic vs real through price/preference
- [ ] Trust readers to understand context
- [ ] Use semantic drift for worldbuilding

## The Payoff
This approach creates a richer, more believable universe where:
- Human culture has spread and adapted
- Class differences show through food choices
- Colony worlds develop their own "traditional" versions
- Earth originals become luxury items
