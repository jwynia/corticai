# Hanging Lanterns on Semantic Drift

## The Principle
When a familiar term has undergone semantic drift, the story MUST acknowledge this shift at least once, or readers will assume Earth-standard meanings.

## Techniques for Hanging the Lantern

### 1. The Clarification Moment
**Example**: "Want some coffee?"
"Real coffee or the regular stuff?"
"You know anyone who can afford real coffee?"

### 2. The Newcomer's Shock
**Example**: "The meat was excellent."
"Wait, this came from an actual animal?"
*Uncomfortable silence*

### 3. The Price Point Reference
**Example**: "Coffee's two certs. Real Earth coffee is two hundred."

### 4. The Origin Marker
**Example**: "Try the Tau Station coffee. Almost as good as the real thing."

### 5. The Quality Complaint
**Example**: "This beer tastes like recycled proteins."
"All beer is recycled proteins. Has been for centuries."
"I know. Still tastes like it."

## Where to Place These Moments

### Early Introduction
- First time the term appears
- Within first 3 chapters ideally
- Before reader assumptions solidify

### Character Moments
- Marcus ordering "real coffee" while others drink regular
- Someone's first time trying "authentic" versions
- Class differences shown through food choices

### Natural Contexts
- Restaurants/bars (menus, ordering)
- Shopping (price comparisons)
- Gifts (real versions as special)
- Nostalgia (remembering old meanings)

## Current Manuscript Needs

### Coffee
**Current**: Marcus drinks real coffee (established)
**Needs**: Someone else drinking regular "coffee" for contrast
**Suggested moment**: Someone offers Marcus coffee, he asks "real or regular?"

### Beer
**Current**: "beer that tasted like recycled water and barley"
**Almost there**: Just needs clarity that most beer isn't from barley anymore

### Meat
**Current**: Not yet established
**Needs**: Clear moment showing "meat" is lab-grown by default
**Suggested**: Restaurant scene or meal description

### Phone/Comm
**Current**: Inconsistent usage
**Needs**: If keeping "phone," need moment showing it means personal comm
**Suggested**: "Phone, comm, whatever you call it these days"

### Truck
**Current**: Used without explanation
**Needs**: Brief indicator it's not wheeled
**Suggested**: "The truck's repulsors whined" or "truck settling on its landing skids"

## The Key Balance

### Too Subtle
❌ Just using the evolved term without any indication

### Too Heavy
❌ "As you know, Bob, coffee now means any roasted stimulant beverage..."

### Just Right
✓ Natural moment of contrast/clarification/price difference

## Implementation Priority

1. **Coffee** - Almost there, needs one clarification
2. **Meat** - High impact, needs clear establishment
3. **Phone/Comm** - Decide on term and clarify once
4. **Beer/Alcohol** - Low priority, almost clear already
5. **Vehicles** - Add repulsor/landing references

## Example Scene Addition

```
Marcus accepted the cup, sniffing suspiciously. "This real?"

"You think I'm made of money? It's good though - Ganymede beans, roasted dark."

He took a sip. Not bad for fungal proteins. Nothing like the Earth coffee in his thermos, but it would do. Most people couldn't even tell the difference anymore.
```

This establishes:
- "Coffee" includes non-Earth varieties
- Real coffee is expensive/rare
- Most people accept the expanded definition
- Marcus can tell the difference (character trait)
