# "Old Future Tech" Revision Principle

## The Core Realization
Even the oldest, most beat-up technology in Marcus's world is more advanced than anything we have today. A 100-year-old cargo hauler still uses antigrav. A 50-year-old comm unit has quantum encryption. 

## What This Means for Revisions

### DON'T Add "Old" Earth Tech
❌ Wheeled vehicles
❌ Physical buttons (unless mil-spec hardened)  
❌ Paper notebooks
❌ Mechanical locks
❌ "Steel-toed boots"

### DO Show Age Through Future Tech
✓ "Fusion core from the Border Wars era"
✓ "First-generation repulsor coils"
✓ "Pre-restriction AI architecture"
✓ "Mil-spec quantum encryption, still uncrackable"
✓ "Original colony-ship alloy plating"

## Practical Examples

### Marcus's Equipment Should Be:
- **40-year-old hauler**: Still has antigrav, just inefficient
- **30-year-old comm**: Military quantum encryption, lower res holo
- **15-year-old Rhea**: More capable than modern restricted AIs
- **20-year-old tools**: Smart diagnostics, just not networked

### Age Indicators:
- Lower efficiency, not lower tech
- Bulkier design, not primitive
- Manual overrides, not manual-only
- Repairable, not simple

## The Sweet Spot
Technology that is:
1. **Old to them** (dismissed as junk)
2. **Advanced to us** (still sci-fi)
3. **Reliable in story** (proven tech)
4. **Character-defining** (shows values)

## Revision Checklist
When updating tech references:
- [ ] Is it still futuristic to modern readers?
- [ ] Does age show through inefficiency not primitiveness?
- [ ] Does it fit the extended lifespan principle?
- [ ] Does it support Marcus's character philosophy?

## Key Phrase for Reference
"In a universe where ships last centuries, 'old reliable' means something different."
