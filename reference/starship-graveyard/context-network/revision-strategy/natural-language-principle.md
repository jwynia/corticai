# Natural Language Evolution Principle

## The Core Insight
People don't explain their everyday technology. They just use it.

## Examples of Natural Evolution

### What We DON'T Say
- "I'll send you an electronic mail message"
- "I'm wearing denim twill-weave pants"
- "Let me check my cellular telephone"
- "I'll drive my internal combustion automobile"

### What We DO Say
- "I'll email you" (or just "I'll send it")
- "I'm wearing jeans"
- "Let me check my phone"
- "I'll drive"

## Application to Starship Graveyard

### Communication
❌ "Quantum-encrypted communication device"
✓ "Comm" or just "called"

### Clothing
❌ "Adaptive thermal regulation garment"
✓ "Thermals" or "suit"

### Transportation
❌ "Repulsor-lifted cargo transport"
✓ "Hauler" or "my ride"

## The Tech Is Invisible Rule
When everyone's clothes regulate temperature, you don't mention it.
When all vehicles hover, you don't say "hover-car."
When all comms are encrypted, you don't say "secure comm."

## Character Voice Examples

### Marcus (practical)
- "Grab your thermals, it's cold out"
- "My hauler's making that noise again"
- "Comm me when you get there"

### Corporate (status-conscious)
- "Nice suit. Core import?"
- "Fresh thermals - someone's doing well"
- "Is that a company hauler?"

### Street (slang heavy)
- "Shiners won't fool anyone" (fake expensive clothes)
- "Burnt my last thermal" (ruined clothes)
- "Rolling heavy" (expensive vehicle)

## Show Tech Through Problems
- "Thermals on the fritz - kept overheating"
- "Comm's glitching since the update"
- "Hauler's eating power cells again"

## Quick Test
Before writing tech description, ask:
1. Would someone in 2024 explain their phone can make calls?
2. Would they mention their car has wheels?
3. Would they note their jacket has zippers?

If no, then don't explain the future tech either.

## The Goal
Readers understand through context, not exposition. Trust them.
