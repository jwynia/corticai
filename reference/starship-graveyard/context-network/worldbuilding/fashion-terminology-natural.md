# Natural Fashion Terminology Evolution

## The Problem with Over-Explanation
"Adaptive formal wear with biometric shielding" is NOT how people talk about clothes. Just like we don't say "denim twill-weave leg coverings" - we say "jeans."

## Natural Language Evolution Principles

### Shortening Over Time
- "Electronic mail" → "email" → "mail"
- "Cellular telephone" → "cell phone" → "phone"
- "Blue jeans" → "jeans"
- "Adaptive thermal suit" → "thermals" or "suits"

### Technology Becomes Invisible
When everyone's clothes regulate temperature, you don't mention it. It's just what clothes DO.

## Better Fashion Terminology

### Keep Simple Terms
- **Suit** - Still a suit, just made of smart fabric
- **Jacket** - Still a jacket, even if it's armor-weaved
- **Jeans** - Could still exist as a style, just different material
- **Boots** - Still boots, even if they're mag-locked

### Add New Terms Sparingly
- **Thermals** - Basic everyday wear (replaced t-shirt/jeans)
- **Formals** - Business/official wear (evolution of suit)
- **Vac-wear** - Clothes that work in vacuum (specialized)
- **Shiners** - Cheap synthetic that looks expensive (slang)

### Show Tech Through Context
Instead of: "He wore an adaptive thermal regulation suit"
Better: "His suit was two years old but still held temperature fine"

Instead of: "armor-weave protective jacket"
Better: "Her jacket had saved her from a knife once - worth every cert"

## Character Examples

### Marcus
- Wears "work thermals" (practical daily wear)
- Has one "good suit" for meetings (older but clean)
- "Boots older than some colonies" (but still mag-capable)

### Detective Oriz
- "Detective coat" - everyone knows it's armored
- Standard enforcement thermals underneath
- "Street boots" - reinforced but doesn't need saying

### Corporate Types
- "Core suits" - implies expensive/imported
- "Fresh thermals" - new, not worn
- "Interview shiners" - fake expensive clothes

## Slang and Cultural Terms

### Age/Quality Indicators
- "Fresh" - brand new
- "Worn" - used but good
- "Thread" - near failure
- "Colony-made" vs "Core-import"

### Style Terms
- "Dock practical" - tough working clothes
- "Station formal" - what passes for nice
- "Grounder style" - trying too hard
- "Spacer cut" - practical for ships

## Implementation Examples

### Original Overwrite
"He adjusted his climate-controlled adaptive business attire"

### Natural Version
"He tugged his suit straight - damn thing never sat right"

### Original Overwrite
"She wore armor-weave tactical protective coating"

### Natural Version  
"Her coat had seen better decades, but the weave would still stop a blade"

## The Key: Less Is More
- People don't explain their clothes' features
- Technology is assumed, not described
- Slang and shortcuts develop naturally
- Character shows through wear and choice

## Quick Reference
- Suit → still "suit" (context shows it's smart fabric)
- Jeans → "work pants" or "thermals"
- T-shirt → "thermal" or "pullover"  
- Jacket → still "jacket" or "coat"
- Dress shoes → "formals"
- Sneakers → "grips" or "mags"

But honestly? Sometimes "jacket" is just fine.
