# Semantic Drift in Food & Beverage Terms

## Core Principle
Terms persist but meanings expand to include alien/synthetic equivalents. The preparation METHOD becomes more important than the specific Earth ingredients.

## Beverages

### Beer/Ale
- **Original**: Fermented Earth grains (barley, wheat) with hops
- **Galactic meaning**: Any fermented grain beverage
- **Examples**: 
  - "Ganymede beer" (from fungal proteins)
  - "Heavy-world ale" (high gravity grains, denser)
  - "Station brew" (whatever grains available)
- **Marcus's take**: Might prefer "real barley beer" as luxury

### Coffee
- **Original**: Roasted coffee beans from Earth
- **Galactic meaning**: Any roasted, brewed stimulant beverage
- **Examples**:
  - "Tau Station coffee" (from modified algae)
  - "Miner's coffee" (harsh, high-caffeine variant)
  - Most people drink various "coffees," Marcus insists on Earth-bean
- **Natural usage**: "Coffee break," "coffee shop" persist

### Tea
- **Already drifted on Earth**: Rooibos, chamomile, etc.
- **Galactic**: Any steeped plant beverage
- **Social function remains**: "Having tea" = social/calming ritual

### Wine
- **Original**: Fermented grapes
- **Galactic**: Any fermented fruit beverage
- **Class markers**: "Core wine" vs "colony wine"

### Whiskey/Spirits
- **Original**: Distilled grains
- **Galactic**: Any distilled beverage following similar process
- **Aging still matters**: "30-year Centauri whiskey"

## Foods

### Meat
- **Original**: Animal muscle tissue
- **Galactic**: Any protein with meat-like texture
- **Types**:
  - "Vat meat" (lab-grown)
  - "Plant meat" (textured proteins)
  - "Real meat" (actual animals, luxury)

### Bread
- **Original**: Baked wheat/grain
- **Galactic**: Any baked grain-like product
- **Station bread": Made from whatever's available

### Cheese
- **Original**: Fermented dairy
- **Galactic**: Any fermented protein with cheese-like properties
- **"Real dairy cheese" = expensive luxury

## Implementation in Text

### Natural Usage
- "Want some coffee?" (doesn't specify which kind)
- "The beer tasted like recycled water" (quality issue, not type)
- "Real coffee costs extra" (Marcus being picky)

### Avoid Over-Explaining
❌ "The coffee - made from roasted Tau algae beans"
✓ "The coffee was bitter but did the job"

### Show Through Context
- Price differences indicate real vs synthetic
- Characters' preferences show class/values
- Quality complaints reveal synthetic nature

## Character Opportunities

### Marcus's Preferences
- Real coffee (established)
- Might also prefer "real barley beer"
- But practical about food (takes what works)

### Class Distinctions
- Rich: Can afford Earth-original ingredients
- Middle: Mix of real and synthetic
- Poor: Whatever's cheapest and filling

### Cultural Identity
- Colonies develop their own "traditional" versions
- Earth foods become almost mythical
- New traditions emerge around local ingredients

## The Key Insight
The FUNCTION matters more than the source:
- Beer = social lubricant, relaxation
- Coffee = stimulation, morning ritual
- Bread = basic sustenance
- Wine = celebration, sophistication

The terms persist because the human needs persist, even when the ingredients change completely.
