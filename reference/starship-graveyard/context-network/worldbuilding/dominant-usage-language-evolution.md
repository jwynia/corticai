# Dominant Usage Claims the Simple Term

## The Principle
Whatever version of something becomes dominant gets the unmarked term. The older/rarer version needs qualifiers.

## Earth Examples (Already Happened)
- **Phone** = mobile → "landline" needs marking
- **Mail** = email → "physical mail" or "snail mail"  
- **Message** = text/digital → "voice message" or "written note"
- **Book** = often digital → "physical book" or "paper book"
- **Photo** = digital image → "print photo" or "physical photo"

## In Starship Graveyard Universe

### Communication
- **Comm** = personal wrist/ear device (dominant)
- **"Wall comm"** = fixed location unit (needs marking)
- **"Physical comm"** = actual handheld device (rare)

### Documentation  
- **Records** = digital/holographic (dominant)
- **"Paper records"** = physical documents (special case)
- **"Written records"** = handwritten (almost extinct)

### Currency
- **Money/Credits** = digital (dominant)
- **"Physical credits"** = chips or tokens (special)
- **"Cash"** = might not even have a meaning

### Food (as discussed)
- **Meat** = lab-grown (dominant)
- **"Animal meat"** = from killed animals (shocking)
- **"Wild meat"** = hunted (barbaric to most)

### Ships/Transport
- **Ship** = spacecraft (dominant)
- **"Wet ship"** = ocean vessel (archaic)
- **"Ground transport"** = non-flying vehicle (marked)

## Implementation in Dialogue

### Natural Usage
"Send me the files" (assumes digital)
"I'll comm you" (assumes personal device)
"Have some meat" (assumes lab-grown)
"Check your account" (assumes digital)

### When Marking is Needed
"I found physical records in the salvage"
"This colony still uses ground transport"  
"They serve animal meat" (whispered in horror)

## Story Opportunities

### Marcus Finding Old Tech
- "Is this a physical comm?"
- "Paper records? How do you search them?"
- "Wall-mounted? But how do you take it with you?"

### Generational Differences
- Older characters might still say "digital records"
- Younger ones just say "records"
- Creates subtle age markers

### Class/Location Markers
- Frontier worlds might have more "old" versions
- Core worlds find physical versions quaint/primitive
- Museums might display "physical money"

## The Key Insight
The simpler the term, the more common the usage. This creates a linguistic archaeology where you can trace technological and social change through which version needs the qualifier.

## Writing Guidelines
1. Use simple terms for dominant tech
2. Add qualifiers only for rare/old versions
3. Show surprise when characters encounter old versions
4. Let context indicate which version is meant
5. Use this for subtle worldbuilding
