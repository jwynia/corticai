# Technology Evolution in Starship Graveyard

## Communication Devices

### Current Anachronisms
- "Phone" / "phone calls" / "burner phone" (Chapters 20, 24, 30, 34)
- People receiving "calls" and having "phone numbers"

### Proposed Evolution

#### Personal Communicators
**Basic Term**: "comm" or "comm unit"
- **Visual**: Worn as bracelet, earpiece, or collar node
- **Interface**: Neural tap, holographic, or voice
- **Features**: 
  - Quantum-encrypted channels
  - Biometric locking
  - Range depends on quality (local/system/interstellar)

#### Specific Replacements
- "Phone" → "comm"
- "Phone call" → "comm ping" or just "call"
- "Burner phone" → "disposable comm" or "grey-market comm"
- "Phone number" → "comm code" or "contact string"

#### Class/Quality Variations
- **High-end**: Neural implants, thought-activated
- **Mid-range**: Wrist units with holo-projection
- **Low-end**: Basic audio-only units
- **Black market**: Scrambled units, untraceable

#### Character Moments
- Marcus using an old but reliable comm unit (salvager mentality)
- Corporate types with sleek neural implants
- Criminals with disposable units they swap frequently
- Someone's comm malfunctioning at crucial moment

### Computing Technology

#### Current State
- Generic "computers" and "terminals"
- Modern Earth-like interfaces

#### Proposed Evolution
- **Quantum cores** for serious processing
- **Holo-displays** instead of screens
- **Gesture/voice/neural** interfaces
- **AI assistants** more common (not just Rhea)

#### Specific Examples
- Marcus's salvage yard uses older holo-displays with gesture controls
- Corporate offices have full-immersion data environments
- Hackers use custom rigs with multiple interface options
- Public terminals are basic but functional

## Transportation

### Current Anachronisms
- "Truck" / "van" (Chapters 21, 30)
- Earth-specific vehicle names

### Proposed Evolution

#### Ground Vehicles

##### Terminology Shifts
- "Truck" → "hauler" or "heavy transport"
- "Van" → "carrier" or "multi-passenger transport"
- "Car" → "grav-car" or "skimmer"

##### Technology Features
- **ALL vehicles use repulsor/grav technology** (even 100-year-old ones)
- **No wheeled vehicles** - that's ancient history
- **Power**: Fusion cores (older) or antimatter cells (newer)
- **Autopilot** standard on new models, manual control on older
- **Age ranges**: 5 years = nearly new, 20-50 years = standard, 100+ years = antique

##### Class Variations
- **Industrial**: Heavy haulers with reinforced frames
- **Corporate**: Sleek skimmers with privacy shielding
- **Civilian**: Practical carriers, some older wheeled models
- **Black market**: Modified units, stealth capabilities

#### Specific Replacements
- "Marcus climbed into his truck" → "Marcus climbed into his hauler"
- "A van pulled up" → "A carrier settled onto its landing skids"
- "The truck's engine" → "The hauler's drive core"

#### Character Details
- Marcus keeps an older model hauler - reliable, easy to repair
- Corporate vehicles are newer, flashier, less practical
- Some colonies still use wheeled vehicles (rough terrain)
- Vehicle choice reflects character/economic status

## Fashion

### Current Anachronisms
- Suits, ties, leather jackets (Chapter 4)
- Jeans, t-shirts
- Unchanged from 21st century Earth

### Proposed Evolution

#### General Principles
1. **Adaptive fabrics** - temperature/pressure regulating
2. **Modular design** - pieces that reconfigure
3. **Cultural mixing** - human/alien fashion fusion
4. **Practical evolution** - fashion serves space-life needs

#### Business Attire
- "Suit" → Still "suit" (smart fabric implied)
- "Tie" → Might be gone or evolved to "tabs" (functional)
- **What's different**: Cut, fabric behavior, hidden features
- **What's the same**: Still signals formality/status

#### Casual Wear  
- "Jeans and t-shirt" → "thermals" (everyday wear)
- **Why it works**: Short, practical, everyone knows what it means
- **Variations**: "work thermals," "fresh thermals," "dock thermals"
- **Key**: The tech is invisible because it's universal

#### Specific Character Looks

##### Marcus (Salvager)
- Reinforced work clothes with many pockets
- Older-style clothing that's been repaired
- Practical over fashionable
- Maybe one "good" outfit for port business

##### Detective Oriz
- "Leather jacket" → "Protective coat with armor weave"
- Professional but practical
- Hidden holsters integrated into clothing
- Authority indicated by cut/color

##### Corporate Types
- Expensive adaptive clothing
- Latest fashion from core worlds
- Integrated tech (clothing that displays data)
- Status symbols in fabric/accessories

#### Cultural Elements
- Colony-specific styles emerging
- Alien fashion influence on human clothing
- Practical adaptations for different gravities
- Religious/cultural dress adapted for space

### Implementation Examples

#### Before
"She wore a leather jacket over a white t-shirt and jeans"

#### After
"She wore a protective coat over fitted thermals and work pants—practical dock worker attire with enough armor weave to stop a knife"

#### Before  
"His expensive suit marked him as corporate"

#### After
"His formal tunic shimmered with adaptive fabric—the kind that cost more than most colonists made in a year, adjusting its temperature and fit with every movement"

## General Tech Principles

1. **Show evolution, not revolution** - recognizable but advanced
2. **Class differences** - tech quality shows economic status
3. **Practical over flashy** - most tech serves daily needs
4. **Colony variations** - different worlds, different solutions
5. **Character through choice** - what tech they use reveals personality
