# Authentic vs Synthetic - Worldbuilding Theme

## Core Concept
The tension between authentic/original items and their synthetic replacements provides rich worldbuilding opportunities and character differentiation.

## Examples in the Manuscript

### Marcus's Coffee
- Most people drink "caff" (synthetic, cheap, efficient)
- Marcus insists on real coffee (expensive, rare, authentic)
- Character trait that shows his values

### Potential Extensions

#### Food
- Synthetic proteins vs "real meat"
- Hydroponic vegetables vs "soil-grown"
- Artificial flavoring vs natural spices

#### Materials
- Synthetic wood vs "Earth oak" or "colony pine"
- Artificial leather vs "genuine hide"
- Lab diamonds vs "natural gems"

#### Experiences
- VR tourism vs actual travel
- Synthetic memories vs lived experience
- AI companionship vs human connection

## Character Differentiation

### Those Who Prefer Authentic
- Salvagers, historians, traditionalists
- Wealthy collectors
- Specific cultural groups

### Those Who Prefer Synthetic
- Practical, efficiency-minded
- Younger generation
- Corporate culture

### Mixed Approach
- Authentic for special occasions
- Synthetic for daily use
- Context-dependent choices

## Economic Implications

### Authentic Goods
- Expensive, status symbols
- Black market potential
- Import/export storylines

### Synthetic Goods
- Ubiquitous, affordable
- Constantly improving
- Corporate controlled

## Story Opportunities

1. **Authentication conflicts** - proving something is "real"
2. **Smuggling plots** - moving authentic goods
3. **Cultural tensions** - preservationists vs progressives
4. **Character moments** - gifts of authentic items
5. **World detail** - markets, shops, preferences

## Implementation Notes

- Don't overuse - select key items for contrast
- Show through action, not exposition
- Use character reactions to establish value
- Consider colony-specific variations
