# Semantic Drift Examples & Story Opportunities

## The "Meat from a Killed Animal" Effect
When semantic drift is complete, the original meaning can become shocking, taboo, or even incomprehensible.

## Potential Shocking Revelations

### Food Origins
- **"Meat from a killed animal"** → Horror/disgust
- **"Cheese from actual animal milk"** → Seems primitive/unsanitary
- **"Eggs from inside a bird"** → Bizarre/disturbing
- **"Honey from insect secretions"** → Revolting

### Complete Semantic Shifts

#### "Meat"
- **Now means**: Lab-grown protein, standard everywhere
- **Original meaning**: Dead animal flesh (shocking, primitive)
- **Story moment**: Character from frontier world casually mentions hunting, others recoil

#### "Milk"
- **Now means**: White protein beverage (various sources)
- **Original meaning**: Bovine mammary secretions (weird, gross)
- **Character reaction**: "You mean from an animal's... body?"

#### "Natural"
- **Now means**: Unmodified by recent tech
- **Original meaning**: From nature (which barely exists)
- **Confusion**: "Natural flavoring" from extinct Earth plants

## Story Implementation Ideas

### Marcus's Salvage Yard
- Finds old Earth food in preserved ship
- "Real meat - Keep Frozen" label
- Horror when crew realizes what it means

### Restaurant Scene
- Menu says "authentic preparation"
- Customer asks what makes it authentic
- Horrified to learn about animal origins

### Class Distinction Reversed
- Poor people might hunt/fish out of necessity
- Seen as barbaric by "civilized" people
- Creates tension between frontier and core worlds

### Archaeological Discovery
- Find records of "factory farming"
- Modern humans can't comprehend the scale
- "They killed HOW many animals per day?"

## Subtle Integration Examples

### Dialogue:
"Try the meat. It's good quality."
"Lab-certified?"
"Of course. What else would it be?"

### Misunderstanding:
"My grandfather was a butcher."
"Oh, protein engineering?"
"No, he... never mind."

### Culture Shock:
Frontier visitor: "I caught dinner."
Station dweller: "Caught? What do you mean caught?"

## The Principle
The more complete the semantic drift, the more alien the original meaning becomes. This creates:
- Culture clash opportunities
- Character moments
- Worldbuilding depth
- Natural conflict

## Things That Might Be Shocking in This Universe

1. **Wooden furniture** from dead trees
2. **Leather** from animal skin
3. **Photographs** on paper (dead trees again)
4. **Books** (physical ones)
5. **Burial** (wasting organic material)
6. **Pets** (keeping animals for no purpose)

## Marcus-Specific Opportunities
As someone who deals with old salvage:
- Finds pre-shift food stores
- Has to explain old terms to younger workers
- Might know the "real" meanings from historical context
- Could use this knowledge to his advantage

## Key Writing Principle
Don't over-explain the shock. Let it land naturally:
❌ "Meat from an animal? How barbaric! In our civilized time..."
✓ "From a what?" followed by uncomfortable silence
