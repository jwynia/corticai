# Marcus's Technology Preferences - Character Building

## Overview
Just as Marcus prefers real coffee over synth-caff, his technology choices reflect his salvager philosophy: proven, reliable, repairable over cutting-edge and disposable.

## Communication Device
- **Uses**: Military-surplus comm from the Border Wars (30 years old)
- **Why**: "Quantum encryption that still works, modular components you can swap"
- **Details**: 
  - Mil-spec hardening against radiation/EMP
  - Holo-projector lower resolution but rock-solid
  - Compatible with dozens of old protocols
  - "They built these to last a campaign, not a fashion season"

## Transportation
- **His Hauler**: 
  - 40-year-old industrial freight hauler (Koyama Heavy Industries)
  - Original repulsor coils, maintained not replaced
  - Drive core is "prehistoric" fusion design - inefficient but indestructible
  - "Ships like this hauled the colony supplies. Still hauling."
- **Character moment**: Others fly modern grav-cars with AI pilots; his hauler needs manual input but "flies like it's on rails"

## Work Clothes
- **Style**: Durable over trendy
  - Industrial vacuum-rated thermals (self-sealing, 20+ years old)
  - Cargo pants with shielded pockets (blocks scanner intrusion)
  - Magboots from a decommissioned freighter crew
- **One Good Outfit**: For port authority meetings
  - Previous-generation adaptive wear
  - Still adjusts temp/pressure but lacks modern biometrics
  - "Respectable enough"

## Tools and Equipment
- **Philosophy**: Understanding over automation
- **Examples**:
  - Diagnostic equipment with manual overrides
  - Quantum locks he can recalibrate himself
  - Data storage with physical backup cores
- **Quote**: "New tools hide what they're doing. Old tools show you."

## Rhea - The Exception That Proves the Rule
- **She's "old reliable" tech too**: Legal-Expert-7 series AI (15+ years old)
- **Why it works**: 
  - LE-7s were overbuilt before AI regulations tightened
  - More autonomous than modern AIs (which are more restricted)
  - Marcus can maintain her hardware himself
  - "They don't make them like you anymore" / "Because I'm too dangerous"
- **Their partnership**: Both prefer proven tech over flashy upgrades

## Story Opportunities

### Character Moments
1. **Teaching moment**: Shows someone how to fix old tech
2. **Vindication**: His old hauler works when others fail
3. **Gift scene**: Someone gives him vintage/quality tool
4. **Contrast**: In corporate office feeling out of place

### Plot Devices
1. **Old tech advantages**: Can't be remotely hacked/tracked
2. **Repair skills**: Fixes something others can't
3. **Network**: Knows other "old tech" enthusiasts
4. **Hidden capabilities**: Old doesn't mean weak

### Dialogue Opportunities
- "That comm's an antique" / "It's called reliable"
- "Why don't you upgrade?" / "Why fix what works?"
- "Your hauler's making that noise again" / "That's how I know it's running"

## Thematic Connection
Marcus's tech preferences reinforce larger themes:
- **Authentic vs synthetic** (real coffee, manual tools)
- **Past vs future** (salvager preserving old ways)
- **Individual vs corporate** (personal choice vs standardization)
- **Knowledge vs convenience** (understanding how things work)

## Specific Examples for Revision

### Comm Device Scene
Instead of: "His phone rang"
Try: "His comm buzzed against his wrist—the old unit's vibration motor rattling louder than newer models, but reliable as sunrise"

### Vehicle Scene
Instead of: "He got in his truck"  
Try: "He climbed into the hauler's worn seat, the manual controls familiar under his hands while the drive core wheezed its usual complaint before catching"

### Clothing Scene
Instead of: "He put on his jacket"
Try: "He shrugged into his work coat—pre-smart fabric but the armor weave would still stop a blade, and the pockets held actual tools instead of charging ports"
