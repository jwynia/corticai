# Technology Generations in Starship Graveyard

## Core Concept: Extended Lifespans
In a spacefaring civilization, technology has extremely long operational lifespans due to:
- Massive initial investment costs
- Over-engineering for reliability
- Scarcity of manufacturing in frontier regions
- Cultural shift toward maintenance over replacement

## Technology Timeline

### 150+ Years Ago: Colony Ships Era
- Massive generation ships and early colony vessels
- Still in service as stations, stripped for parts, or museums
- "Built to last centuries because they had to"
- Marcus might salvage from these titans

### 100-150 Years Ago: First Expansion
- Early FTL drives (inefficient but indestructible)
- First-generation terraforming equipment
- Mining ships built like fortresses
- Some still operating in outer systems

### 50-100 Years Ago: The Build-Out
- Infrastructure boom across colonies
- Standardized designs for reliability
- **Rhea's era**: LE-7 AIs built without modern restrictions
- Heavy industrial equipment still forms backbone of many operations

### 30-50 Years Ago: The Border Wars
- Military-spec equipment built for extremes
- **Marcus's comm unit** from this era
- Over-engineered for survival
- Civilian tech influenced by military designs

### 10-30 Years Ago: Modern Standardization
- More regulations, planned obsolescence creeping in
- AI restrictions after "incidents"
- Cheaper materials, faster replacement cycles
- Beginning of "disposable" tech culture

### Present Day: The Divide
- High-end: Neural interfaces, full automation
- Low-end: Maintaining 50-year-old equipment
- Most people never see truly "new" ships
- Salvagers like Marcus keep old tech running

## Why "Old" Tech Is Still Advanced

### Marcus's 40-Year-Old Hauler
- Uses repulsor technology (no wheels ever)
- Fusion drive core (inefficient by modern standards)
- Manual controls but still has basic AI assist
- Built when things were made to last

### His 30-Year-Old Military Comm
- Quantum encryption (unbreakable even now)
- Hardened against radiation/EMP
- Lower resolution holo but reliable
- Compatible with dozens of protocols

### Rhea (15-Year-Old AI)
- More capable than modern restricted AIs
- Built before the "Tau Station Incident" led to AI limitations
- Self-modifying code (now illegal)
- Marcus maintains her because new AIs are "lobotomized"

## Cultural Impact

### "New" Is Rare
- Most colonists live entire lives without seeing new ships
- "New" hauler might be 10 years old from factory
- True cutting-edge tech only in Core Worlds
- Frontier makes do with maintained equipment

### Maintenance Culture
- Repair skills highly valued
- "Fifty-year parts" is a selling point
- Generational knowledge passed down
- Some families maintain same ship for centuries

### Economic Reality
- New shuttle: 10 million certs
- Used shuttle (30 years): 500,000 certs
- Maintenance contract: 10,000 certs/year
- Clear economic incentive to maintain

## Story Implications

### Marcus's Philosophy Makes Sense
- Not nostalgic for "old" but practical
- Chooses repairable over disposable
- His 40-year-old hauler is middle-aged, not ancient
- Rhea is "proven tech" not "antique"

### Class Distinctions
- Rich: New tech every decade
- Middle: Maintained 20-50 year tech
- Poor: Whatever still runs
- Salvagers: Keep civilization running

### Plot Opportunities
- Finding truly ancient tech (100+ years)
- Contrast between Core World and Frontier tech
- Maintenance knowledge as valuable skill
- Old tech with capabilities banned in new models

## Quick Examples

### Ships
- New liner: "Only five years old!" (amazingly new)
- Working freighter: "Good Yamato-class, only sixty years old"
- Ancient hulk: "Colony ship from the First Wave" (150+ years)

### Personal Tech
- Cutting edge: Neural implant (last 2 years)
- Standard: 10-20 year old comm units
- Old reliable: 30-50 year military/industrial gear
- Antique: 100+ year colony ship equipment

### The Key Insight
In this universe, a 50-year-old fusion drive isn't old—it's proven. A 30-year-old military comm isn't outdated—it's reliable. And a 15-year-old AI isn't obsolete—she's from before they started limiting AI capabilities.

Marcus doesn't use old human tech—he uses old future tech that's still more advanced than anything we have but represents the "reliable generation" in his time.
