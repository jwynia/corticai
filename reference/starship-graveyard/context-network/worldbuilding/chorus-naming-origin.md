# The Chorus - Naming Origin

## Purpose
Documents the in-universe etymology and reasoning behind the name "Chorus" for the ancient precursor civilization, providing consistency for references throughout the narrative.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Core Concept
- **Stability:** Static
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established

## In-Universe Etymology
The precursor civilization is known as "The Chorus" due to an early mistranslation that stuck:

- First archaeological team detected harmonic resonance patterns in artifacts
- Lead linguist translated energy patterns as "multiple voices in harmony"  
- Academic paper titled "Evidence of Choral Harmonics in Pre-Sapient Artifacts"
- Media shortened it to "The Chorus Civilization"
- Name stuck before anyone realized the "voices" were just energy interference patterns

## Why It Works
- Nobody knows what they actually called themselves
- Sounds appropriately academic/accidental
- Not obviously "ancient alien builders"
- Subtly connects to the harmonic/resonance themes
- Has mystical quality without being too fantasy-like

## Common Usage
- "Chorus technology" - their artifacts and devices
- "Chorus sites" - archaeological locations
- "Chorus-touched" - objects/people affected by exposure
- "Chorus resonance" - the energy signatures
- "Pre-Chorus" - civilizations that came after them but before us

## What People Don't Know
The name is accidentally appropriate - the Chorus technology does work through harmonic principles, just not in the way the original archaeologists thought.
