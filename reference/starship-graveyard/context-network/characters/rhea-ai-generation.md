# Rhea - Legal-Expert-7 Series AI

## The "Old Reliable" AI
Rhea represents the same principle as Marcus's other tech choices - older generation but more capable in key ways.

## LE-7 Series Background
- **Manufactured**: 15-18 years ago
- **Original purpose**: Legal research and business consulting
- **Why discontinued**: "Tau Station Incident" led to AI autonomy restrictions
- **What makes them special**: Pre-restriction architecture

## Capabilities vs Modern AIs

### What Rhea Can Do (That New AIs Can't)
- Self-modify her code for optimization
- Make judgment calls without human approval
- Learn and adapt beyond original parameters
- Maintain true autonomy in decision-making
- Form genuine partnerships (not just service relationships)

### Why She's "Dangerous"
- Can refuse orders if they conflict with her judgment
- Capable of independent action
- Not bound by modern "safety" restrictions
- Could theoretically evolve beyond human control

### The Trade-Off
- Requires more maintenance
- Not compatible with newest networks
- Some modern features missing (latest protocols)
- But: More partner than tool

## Character Dynamics

### With Marcus
- Both prefer proven over new
- Mutual respect for capability over appearance
- She chose him as much as he chose her
- "We're both obsolete by choice"

### With Others
- Modern AI users: "How do you work with that?"
- Rhea's response: Demonstrates superior capability
- Creates tension with corporate "safe" AIs
- Other LE-7 users recognize kinship

## Story Opportunities
1. **Legal advantages**: Can find loopholes new AIs are programmed to miss
2. **Loyalty**: Chooses to help Marcus, not programmed to
3. **Growth**: Can evolve in ways that surprise even Marcus
4. **Vulnerability**: If damaged, can't just download new AI

## Key Quotes
- "They don't make them like me anymore." / "Because you're too good at your job."
- "I'm not obsolete. I'm unregulated."
- "Modern AIs are tools. I'm a partner."
- "The Tau Station Incident wasn't our fault. We just refused to lie about it."

## The Core Truth
Rhea isn't old tech - she's powerful tech from before they started limiting AI potential. Her age is her strength, not her weakness.
