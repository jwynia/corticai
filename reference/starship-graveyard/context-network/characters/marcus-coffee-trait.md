# Marcus's Coffee Preference - Character Trait

## Overview
In a universe where most people drink synthetic "caff," Marcus Patel insists on real coffee - a character detail that reinforces his core personality traits.

## Character Significance

### Ties to Salvager Identity
- Values authentic/original items over synthetic replacements
- Appreciates things with history and provenance
- Willing to pay extra or go to trouble for the "real thing"

### Shows His Stubbornness
- Won't compromise on this one comfort
- Maintains the ritual despite it being impractical
- Others see it as an endearing quirk or annoying affectation

### Connection to the Past
- Coffee represents pre-space Earth traditions
- Links to his morning routine at the salvage yard
- Grounds him (literally) in physical reality vs digital/synthetic

## Implementation Ideas

### Scenes Where This Could Add Depth
- Others offering him caff, him politely declining
- Him bringing his own coffee to meetings
- Rhea teasing him about his "expensive addiction"
- Using real coffee beans as a minor plot point (trade, gift, bribe)
- Someone trying to win him over with real coffee

### Dialogue Opportunities
- "Is that... real coffee?" / "Can't stand that synthetic stuff"
- "You know caff is chemically identical" / "It's not about the chemistry"
- "Where do you even GET real beans these days?"
- Comments about the expense/rarity

### World-Building Through Contrast
- Most spaceports only serve caff
- Real coffee is imported luxury item
- Some colonies try to grow it in domes
- Black market for "authentic Earth goods"

## Revision Notes

When revising coffee references:
1. Marcus always drinks real coffee
2. Others typically drink caff
3. Coffee makers in public spaces dispense caff
4. Marcus's coffee is noted as unusual/expensive
5. Use this to show his character without exposition
