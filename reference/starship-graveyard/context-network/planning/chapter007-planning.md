# Chapter 7 Planning - The Truth of Gamma-12

## Overview
Chapter 7 represents Story Circle Stage 5 (FIND) where Marcus and team infiltrate Gamma-12, discover the full scope of Stellarion's fraud, and locate crucial evidence. This is where they "find" what they're looking for but also discover the situation is more complex than expected.

## Story Circle Position
**Stage 5:** FIND - Discovery phase
- Team infiltrates the site successfully
- Discovers evidence of massive fraud
- Finds Kess Trizik (alive but in hiding)
- Uncovers the true scale of destruction
- Corporate security closing in

- Team splits up to cover more ground quickly

**Character Focus**: Marcus's authentication abilities proven
**Tension**: Security patrols, limited time window

### Scene 2: The Prop Warehouse
**Purpose**: Document the fraud infrastructure
**Key Elements**:
- Kit Salazar and Dr. Chen discover warehouse of fake artifacts
- Serial numbers, manufacturing dates, shipping manifests
- Different props for different investor presentations
- Evidence of previous "discoveries" from destroyed sites
- Realization that every revolutionary claim has been a lie

**Character Focus**: Kit's expertise in tracking false claims
**Revelation**: The industrial scale of the deception

**Purpose**: Discover the hidden witness/evidence
**Key Elements**:
- Marcus senses genuine Chorus activity deeper in the site
- Finds Kess Trizik alive, hiding in original Chorus chambers
- Trizik has been documenting the site for weeks

- Has samples from 12 previously destroyed sites

**Character Focus**: Trizik as the key witness
**Stakes Raised**: Demolition team arriving sooner than expected

### Scene 4: The Financial Records
**Purpose**: Find the smoking gun evidence
**Key Elements**:
- Dr. Vera Sandoval accesses Stellarion's on-site servers
- Discovers complete financial records of the fraud
- Internal communications joking about "investor gullibility"
- Video recordings of executives planning destructions
- Alert triggered - security converging on their location

**Character Focus**: Team cohesion under pressure
**Cliffhanger**: Must escape with evidence as security closes in

## Key Themes for Chapter 7

### Archaeological Crime
- Contrast between genuine Chorus beauty and cheap props
- The tragedy of destroying irreplaceable history
- Corporate greed vs. cultural heritage

### Genre Awareness
- Characters comment on how "convenient" finding everything is
- "It's like they wanted to get caught" observations
- Mockery of typical "ancient alien technology" tropes

### Evidence Over Adventure
- Focus on documentation, not action heroics
- Legal admissibility of evidence gathered
- Building an airtight case, not just accusations

## Dialogue Samples

**On finding the prop warehouse:**
Marcus: "Let me guess - the 'consciousness preservation pods' for medical investors are over there?"
Kit: "Right next to the 'tactical teleportation platforms' for the military. Same basic shell, different paint job."

**Kess Trizik's revelation:**
Trizik: "They've been using the same thirty props for five years. Just rearrange them, add some lights, call it revolutionary. Investors never ask to test anything before the site conveniently explodes."

**On the financial records:**
Dr. Sandoval: "They're not even trying to hide it in the internal emails. Listen to this: 'Q3 projections require at least two more site destructions. Marketing suggests "dimensional gateway" and "time crystal reactor" as this quarter's discoveries.'"

## Technical Elements

### Site Layout
- Genuine Chorus architecture: flowing, organic, integrated
- Stellarion additions: obvious, clunky, purely functional
- Clear distinction between real and fake

### Evidence Types
- Physical samples with quantum signatures
- Financial records and communications
- Video documentation of prop placement
- Destruction schedule and methodology

### Security Systems
- Human guards (not AI) to avoid legal complications
- Standard corporate security, not military
- Designed to keep journalists out, not serious infiltrators

## Character Development

### Marcus
- Confidence in his authentication abilities
- Growing anger at the destruction
- Leadership emerging under pressure

### Detective Oriz
- In her element gathering evidence
- Professional satisfaction at finding proof
- Preparing legal strategy while in field

### Kess Trizik (Introduction)
- Crux archaeologist, deeply offended by site destruction
- Has been living in the site for weeks
- Chose to stay and document rather than flee
- Carries the grief of witnessing cultural destruction

### Team Dynamics
- Working smoothly together now
- Each using their expertise effectively
- Trust established through action

## Escalation Points

1. **Discovery of scale**: Not just Gamma-12, but evidence of 60+ destroyed sites
2. **Time pressure**: Demolition moved up, perhaps hours not days
3. **Evidence quality**: Better than hoped - internal communications damn them
4. **Security response**: They know the team is there
5. **Moral weight**: Seeing the beauty about to be destroyed

## Connection to Overall Plot

- Advances from investigation to prosecution phase
- Provides all evidence needed for legal action
- Introduces Kess Trizik as crucial witness
- Sets up for Chapter 8 escape sequence
- Establishes stakes for final confrontation

## Key Questions Raised

1. Can they escape with the evidence intact?
2. Will Stellarion destroy the site with them in it?
3. How quickly can they act on the evidence?
4. Who in Stellarion ordered Dr. Reeves killed?
5. How many other sites are scheduled for destruction?

## Sensory Details

### Auditory
- Hum of genuine Chorus resonance
- Echo in vast ancient chambers
- Distant sounds of demolition prep
- Alert klaxons when discovered

### Tactile
- Smooth, warm Chorus surfaces
- Cold corporate additions
- Weight of evidence containers
- Urgency in every movement

## Pacing
- Steady build through infiltration
- Momentary awe at genuine architecture
- Rising tension as evidence mounts
- Frantic energy as security responds
- Cliffhanger ending demanding Chapter 8

This chapter transforms the story from investigation to action, from suspicion to proof, from individual crime to systemic fraud. It provides the "find" that justifies everything they've sacrificed while raising stakes for the escape.
