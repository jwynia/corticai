# Criminal Escalation Pattern - Stellarion's Evolution

## The Original Crime (Years 1-5)
**Simple Archaeological Fraud**
- Find genuine Chorus sites
- Document real discoveries
- Inflate their importance for investors
- Profit ceiling: ~100 million credits/year
- **Barrier**: Limited by actual discoveries, archaeological oversight

## First Escalation (Years 6-10)
**Controlled Destruction**
- Destroy sites after documentation
- Claim "accidents" and collect insurance
- Create scarcity to increase values
- Profit ceiling: ~500 million credits/year
- **Barrier**: Running out of sites, insurance investigators getting suspicious
- **Moral Line Crossed**: Destroying irreplaceable heritage for profit

## Second Escalation (Years 11-15)
**The Forgery System**
- Mix real fragments with fakes
- Corrupt authentication boards
- Create artificial market in "Chorus artifacts"
- Profit ceiling: ~2 billion credits/year
- **Barrier**: Need for money laundering services, criminal connections
- **Moral Line Crossed**: Corrupting entire academic field, poisoning historical record

## Third Escalation (Years 16-20)
**Criminal Service Provider**
- Become money laundering service for organized crime
- Pre-sell artifacts from sites not yet "discovered"
- Murder whistleblowers (Dr. Reeves)
- Profit ceiling: ~10 billion credits/year
- **Barrier**: Too many people know, evidence everywhere
- **Moral Line Crossed**: Murder becomes routine "risk management"

## The Current Crisis (Year 21)
**What Happens When You Can't Stop**
- Too big to fail - criminal organizations depend on them
- Can't stop without being killed by "clients"
- Must expand to new sectors to maintain growth
- Everyone involved is compromised
- **The Trap**: The criminals they serve won't let them stop

## Evidence Marcus's Team Would Find:

### Early Records (Innocent Beginning)
- Legitimate archaeological surveys
- Real discoveries, honest research
- Excitement about Chorus technology
- "This could change everything!"

### The First Compromise
- Insurance claims on first "accident"
- Internal debate about ethics
- "Just this once to cover research costs"
- Rationalization documents

### The Slide
- Discussions about "managing" site access
- First forgery attempts ("just to have examples")
- Bribing the first authenticator
- "We're too deep to stop now"

### Full Corruption
- Murder discussed as business expense
- Client demands for more volume
- Threats from criminal organizations
- Executives who want out "having accidents"

## Key Revelation for Chapter 7:

They find evidence that Stellarion executives TRIED to stop five years ago:

**Internal Memo**: "The board has discussed winding down the artifact division. However, our analysis shows that several of our major clients would view this as a breach of our ongoing arrangements. Legal has advised that attempting to cease operations would likely result in significant personnel risks."

**Translation**: The criminals won't let us stop without killing us all.

## This Explains:

1. **Why they keep destroying sites** - Criminal clients demand steady supply
2. **Why they killed Dr. Reeves** - He threatened the flow clients depend on
3. **Why security is so heavy** - Not just protecting from law enforcement, but from their own clients
4. **Why records are so detailed** - Insurance against their criminal partners
5. **Why they can't stop** - They're trapped by their own success

## The Real Horror:

It started as simple fraud - inflate some discoveries, make some money. But each escalation required darker choices, bringing in worse people, until they were trapped in a system that kills anyone who threatens the flow of laundered money.

Some executives probably want out but can't leave without "accidents." They've become prisoners of their own criminal evolution.

## For the Story:

This adds layers:
- Not all Stellarion employees are evil - some are trapped
- The company itself is a victim of its own success
- Stopping them requires protecting witnesses from criminal retaliation
- The real villains might be the criminal organizations they serve
- Some executives might flip if offered protection

## Dialogue Example:

Marcus finds a suicide note from a former executive:
"I helped build this system. I thought we were just exaggerating discoveries for investors. Now I process orders for terrorists and watch sites burn. I've tried to quit three times. Two 'accidents' later, I understand. The only way out is death. At least this way, my family gets the insurance."

This pattern - where breaking through profit barriers requires moral compromises that eventually trap everyone involved - makes the villainy more realistic and terrifying.
