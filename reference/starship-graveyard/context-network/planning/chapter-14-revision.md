# Chapter 14 Revision Plan

## Current Story Position
- Chapter 13 ends with Marcus and team having rescued victims from Hadal
- They've discovered Stellarion has moved up the Site 12 timeline to 18 hours
- Marcus has made the decision that they need to act, but the team is scattered and regrouping
- This is Chapter 14 of 40 - we're in the early-middle section, not the climax

## What Chapter 14 Should Actually Be
Based on story structure and pacing, Chapter 14 should:

### Title: "Unexpected Allies"

### Main Elements:
1. **Regrouping and Recovery**
   - Team reconvenes at a new safe house
   - Treating wounded (Jake, rescued victims)
   - Rhea recovering from the extraction attempts

2. **New Information/Ally**
   - Introduction of someone who can help with understanding Chorus sites
   - Perhaps a xenoarchaeologist or a Chorus culture expert
   - This person provides crucial context about what the sites really are

3. **Preparation Phase**
   - Planning next moves with the 18-hour deadline
   - Discovering they need more resources/information before attempting Site 12
   - Realizing the direct assault would be suicide without proper preparation

4. **Complication**
   - Stellarion's response to the Hadal raid
   - Increased security, public relations spin
   - Legal/political pressure on the investigation team

5. **Setup for Next Chapters**
   - Establishing that they need to gather more evidence
   - Planning to infiltrate Stellarion through other means first
   - Building toward the salvage yard attack (Chapter 22) and major revelation (Chapter 20)

## Why This Works Better
- Maintains proper pacing for a 40-chapter story
- Allows for character development and relationship building
- Sets up future plot points without rushing to climax
- Gives time to explore the Chorus civilization mystery
- Creates space for the investigation to develop naturally

## Next Steps
1. Archive the current Chapter 14 as a future chapter (possibly Chapter 35-38 range)
2. Write new Chapter 14 following this outline
3. Update context network with adjusted timeline
