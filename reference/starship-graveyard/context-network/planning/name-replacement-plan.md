# Character Name Replacement Plan

## Rationale
Following the median blindspot detection framework, we need to avoid clustering around "safe diverse" names like Chen, Kim, Martinez, and Vasquez. These names are overrepresented in LLM-generated fiction and don't fit our established galactic evolution naming patterns.

## Name Replacements

### 1. Dr. James Chen → Dr. James Cern
- **Appears in**: Chapter 5 (financial forensics specialist)
- **Rationale**: Evolved form, avoids Chen clustering

### 2. Dr. Chen (different character) → Dr. Chandra
- **Appears in**: Chapters 13 (rescue scene), possibly others
- **Rationale**: Different cultural origin, naturally evolved

### 3. Dr. Kim → Dr. Keres
- **Appears in**: Chapters 8, 12, 13, 14
- **Rationale**: Evolved form fitting with Kess pattern, Greek mythology origin

### 4. Captain Chen Zhao → Captain Zara Volkov
- **Appears in**: Chapter 14
- **Rationale**: Uses existing surname from story, avoids double clustering

### 5. Dr. Martinez → Dr. Martel
- **Appears in**: Chapters 10, 11, 12, 13, 14
- **Rationale**: Evolved form similar to Patel pattern

### 6. Dr. Elena Vasquez → Dr. Eleni Voss
- **Appears in**: Chapters 8, 14
- **Rationale**: Simplified evolution, fits with Vex pattern

### 7. Dr. Emerson → Dr. Emil Reeves (or just Emil)
- **Appears in**: Chapters 5, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13
- **Rationale**: Already established as Emil Reeves' alias

## Implementation Notes

### Special Cases:
- "We lost Chen" in Chapter 13 refers to a victim who died - this should become "We lost Chandra"
- Some "Dr. Chen" references might be Dr. James Chen/Cern specifically
- Dr. Kim appears in both museum context (Ch 8) and medical context (Ch 12-14) - verify if same character

### Consistency Checks:
- Ensure pronouns match (Dr. Keres, Dr. Voss are both female)
- Check dialogue tags and action beats
- Verify no duplicate names with existing characters

## Existing Name Patterns (for reference)
- **Evolved/Blended**: Patel, Oriz, Quinnett, Wren, Vex, Kess Trizik
- **Simple/Universal**: Marcus, Jake, Tom, Kit, Carlos
- **Professional surnames**: Reeves, Park, Salazar, Maddox
- **AI Convention**: Astronomical names (Rhea, ARIA, MINERVA, etc.)

## Next Steps
1. Run replacements across all affected chapters
2. Double-check context for each replacement
3. Update character reference documents
4. Ensure no new clustering patterns emerge
