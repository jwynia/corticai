- Replaced "smuggled Crux artifacts with experimental modifications" → "smuggled ancient alien artifacts with professional excavation tools"
- Replaced "Project Resonance" references → "illegal excavation sites"
- Replaced "consciousness-bridging drugs" → "preservation chemicals used in black-market artifact handling"
- Replaced "AI-Crux experiments" → "artifact smuggling operations"
- Replaced "bio-tech fusion" → "unknown technological properties"
- Replaced "consciousness-interface hardware" → "archaeological preservation equipment"

### 2. Chapter 5 Planning (chapter005_planning.md)
**Key Changes:**
- Replaced "researcher in hiding" → "archaeologist in hiding after exposing site destruction"
- Replaced "consciousness bridging" references → "archaeological smuggling" and "site preservation"
- Replaced "Kess Trizik, key to consciousness bridging" → "Kess Trizik, knew locations of major undiscovered sites"
- Replaced "Test Subject Files" → "Destroyed Site Documentation"
- Replaced "Emerson's hybrid existence" → "Emerson's hidden evidence of archaeological crimes"
- Replaced "rescue mission" → "race to save archaeological sites"
- Replaced all technical consciousness elements with archaeological documentation and preservation techniques

### 3. Chapter 6 Planning (chapter006_planning.md)
**Key Changes:**
- Replaced "consciousness rescuer" → "archaeological protector"
- Replaced "neural preparation" → "archaeological documentation training"
- Replaced "consciousness interface techniques" → "rapid site documentation techniques"
- Replaced "hybrid entity systems" → "artifact preservation systems"
- Replaced "facility" references → "archaeological site" references
- Replaced all consciousness-related technical elements with archaeological scanning and preservation equipment

### 4. Current Status (current_status.md)
**Key Changes:**
- Replaced "Project Resonance files and modified Crux artifacts" → "illegal excavation files and ancient alien artifacts"
- Replaced "consciousness bridging revelation" → "archaeological smuggling revelation"
- Replaced "rescue attempt" → "site preservation"
- Replaced "investigator/rescuer identity" → "investigator/protector identity"

### 5. Chapter 5 Evaluation (chapter005_evaluation.md)
**Key Changes:**
- Replaced all "consciousness rescuer" references → "site protector" or "archaeological protector"
- Replaced "consciousness bridging technology" → "archaeological smuggling operation"
- Replaced "consciousness bridging experiments" → "destruction of irreplaceable cultural heritage sites"
- Replaced "rescue mission" → "preservation mission"

### 6. Chapter 6 Evaluation (chapter006_evaluation.md)
**Key Changes:**
- Replaced "consciousness interface" → "archaeological documentation"
- Replaced "rescue" → "preservation"
- Replaced "facility" → "site"
- Replaced consciousness-related training with archaeological documentation training

### 7. Chapter 3 Refined (chapter003_refined.md)
**Key Changes:**
- Replaced "neural lace still glowing" → "archaeological site coordinates on tablet still glowing"
- Replaced "Dr. Emerson's proprietary neural lace design" → "Dr. Emerson's proprietary archaeological database"
- Replaced "FAILSAFE" data shard → "SITES MANIFEST" data shard
- Updated Dr. Emerson's hologram message to reference site destruction instead of consciousness experiments

## Theme Consistency
The new archaeological crimes theme maintains:
- The same sense of urgency (sites being destroyed vs. consciousness experiments)
- Corporate antagonists (Stellarion Corp) with similar motivations
- The mystery/thriller genre requirements
- Character arcs and transformations
- Technical complexity through archaeological methods instead of consciousness technology

## Horror Elements Transformation
- **Old:** Horror of trapped consciousnesses and hybrid entities
- **New:** Horror of systematic destruction of irreplaceable cultural heritage and civilizations' histories

## Core Mystery Transformation
- **Old:** Project Resonance consciousness bridging experiments
- **New:** Illegal archaeological site network and systematic cultural destruction for profit

This transformation maintains the story structure while shifting to archaeological preservation themes that avoid the consciousness/AI horror elements.
