# Chapter 5 - Revised Scenes (Crime/Corruption Focus)

## Key Changes Overview
- Transform consciousness bridging into financial fraud/site destruction evidence
- Dr. Vera Sandoval is now an archaeological preservation advocate, not consciousness researcher
- Underground network is whistleblowers documenting corporate crimes
- Focus on exposing multi-billion credit fraud scheme

## Scene 1: Following Oriz's Lead (Revised)

[Keep opening until the artifact examination, then:]

"Hidden compartment in the Oort Serval. There were three others like it."

"Three others." She picked up the artifact with professional interest, turning it to examine the data modules. "Emil managed to document evidence from multiple sites."

"Evidence of what?"

Dr. Vera Sandoval looked up at him, and Marcus saw something in her eyes that might have been hope mixed with anger. "The biggest archaeological fraud in human history, Mr. Patel. They're not discovering revolutionary technology. They're running a con game with entire civilizations as props."

Marcus felt the room grow colder. "That's a serious accusation."

"I have the receipts. Literally." She pulled up financial records on her tablet. "Watch this."

Detective Morgan Oriz leaned forward. "What exactly is Project Excavation?"

Dr. Vera Sandoval set the artifact down and pulled up a timeline on one of her tablets. The screen showed stock price movements overlaid with site destruction dates.

"Three years ago, Stellarion 'discovered' revolutionary energy technology at Site Gamma-7," she began, falling into the precise tone of someone who'd given this presentation before. "Stock price jumped 340%. Two weeks later, the site suffered a 'catastrophic resonance cascade' that destroyed all evidence. They collected insurance, shorted their own stock on the way down, and made profit both ways."

She pulled up another file showing similar patterns. "Then they found 'consciousness preservation technology' at Site Delta-3. Different division, different investors, same pattern. Pump, dump, destroy, collect insurance."

"So they're making different claims to different audiences," Marcus said.

"Exactly. Marketing calls it 'targeted narrative deployment.'" Dr. Vera Sandoval's voice took on a bitter edge. "To the military, they're developing weapons. To medical investors, it's longevity tech. To energy companies, it's unlimited power. And when anyone asks to verify the claims..."

Detective Morgan Oriz was taking notes. "The sites have mysteriously been destroyed."

"Every single time." Dr. Vera Sandoval pulled up photos that made Marcus wince. "These were priceless archaeological sites. Actual remnants of the Chorus civilization. Now they're craters because destroying evidence is more profitable than preserving history."

Marcus stared at the destruction on the screen. "And Dr. Reeves documented all this?"

"Emil spent the last year of his life tracking the pattern. Site visits, destruction orders, stock movements, insurance claims." She paused, looking at Marcus with new interest. "He said someone at the salvage yard would understand the shimmer meant something real, not the fairy tales Stellarion was selling."

"The shimmer?" Marcus felt his pulse quicken. "You mean the resonance patterns?"

"Real Chorus sites have a specific energy signature. You've been unconsciously detecting it for years. Emil thought that sensitivity would help someone see through Stellarion's lies." Dr. Vera Sandoval leaned back in her chair. "Most people want to believe in revolutionary discoveries. But you know real Chorus tech when you see it, which means you know when they're lying."

The implications of that statement hit Marcus differently now. "You're saying I'm valuable because I can call bullshit on their claims?"

"You're probably one of maybe a dozen people in the sector who can verify if a site is genuine Chorus architecture or just a hole in the ground with props. Which means you're valuable to them as a validator, and dangerous to them as a whistleblower."

Detective Morgan Oriz closed her notebook. "How many people knew about this investigation?"

"The core team was twelve researchers across four different sectors. Most of us were investigating different angles until Emil connected the pattern." Dr. Vera Sandoval pulled up another file, this one showing a list of names. Several were marked with red X's. "Seven are dead. Three are missing, including Kess Trizik."

"Kess Trizik?" Marcus asked.

"Crux archaeologist who was documenting genuine sites before Stellarion could destroy them. Has photographs and samples that prove the sites were real before destruction. Trizik disappeared the same week as Emil." She paused, listening to something Marcus couldn't hear. "If we're going to expose this fraud, we need Trizik's evidence."

## Scene 2: Corporate Escalation (Revised)

[Keep most of the scene but change the underground meeting:]

Marcus followed her and Detective Morgan Oriz into the warehouse. The space had been converted into something between a documentation center and a bunker. Workstations with financial analysis software, walls covered with site destruction timelines, and boxes of physical evidence waiting to be catalogued.

Three people were waiting for them—two women and a man, all with the exhausted look of people who'd been building a legal case for too long.

"This is Dr. Elena Park," Dr. Vera Sandoval said, indicating a woman in her fifties with ink-stained fingers. "She's been tracking the insurance fraud angle. Dr. James Chen," she gestured to the man, "financial forensics specialist. And Kit Salazar, who's been documenting the false claims to investors."

Marcus felt like he was being inducted into a financial crimes investigation unit. "How many people are in this network?"

"Worldwide? Maybe thirty people documenting the fraud. In this sector, just us." Dr. Park looked at Detective Morgan Oriz. "You're taking a big risk being here, Detective. Stellarion has a lot of influence with law enforcement."

"Let me worry about my career," Detective Morgan Oriz said. "What can you tell us about Dr. Reeves's death?"

Dr. Chen pulled up security footage on one of the workstations. "Emil was getting close to having enough evidence for authorities to act. He'd documented the full pattern—sixty sites destroyed, 4.7 billion in fraudulent gains, fake discoveries tailored to different investor groups."

The video showed Dr. Reeves entering a Stellarion building three days before his death. 

"He went to confront them with the evidence," Kit Salazar said quietly. "Thought if he showed them what he had, they'd stop destroying sites to cover their tracks."

"That was naive," Marcus said.

"That was Emil. Always believed in giving people a chance to do the right thing." Dr. Vera Sandoval's voice was heavy with grief. "They killed him and made it look accidental. But he'd already distributed the evidence. That's what was in your artifacts—financial records, site documentation, proof of the fraud."

"So we have everything we need to expose them?" Detective Morgan Oriz asked.

"Almost. We need Kess Trizik's physical evidence—actual samples from the destroyed sites that prove they contained genuine Chorus artifacts, not the props Stellarion claims." Dr. Park pulled up a map. "Trizik was last seen near the Gamma-12 site."

"The one they're planning to destroy next week," Dr. Chen added. "Claiming they found 'transdimensional gateway technology' this time."

Marcus laughed bitterly. "Let me guess—different story for military contractors?"

"'Tactical teleportation systems,'" Kit confirmed. "And for medical investors, it's 'instant trauma transport.' They're not even trying to keep their lies consistent anymore."

## Scene 3: Personal Stakes Rise (Revised)

[Keep the phone call with Rhea and the stakes, but adjust the warehouse discussion:]

"Rhea," he said, "start emergency shutdown procedures. Upload all financial evidence to secure servers. We're getting you out of there."

"Where are we going?"

"To stop a 4.7 billion credit fraud and save one of the last intact Chorus sites." Marcus stood up, feeling something shift inside him—not just determination, but clarity. "And to prove that revolutionary discoveries don't excuse destroying history."

Dr. Vera Sandoval was already moving, gathering evidence files and documentation. "I'll contact our allies. We have a narrow window before they destroy Gamma-12."

"Detective," Marcus said, "you don't have to come with us. This isn't your fight."

Detective Morgan Oriz was checking her weapon. "Financial fraud resulting in destruction of cultural heritage sites? This is exactly why I joined financial crimes." She looked up at him. "Plus, I really want to see their faces when their stock manipulation scheme falls apart."

Marcus felt the last connection to his old life snap. No yard, no port spot, no comfortable routine. Just a chance to expose the truth and maybe save one site from destruction.

"How do we approach Gamma-12 without getting killed?" he asked.

"Carefully," Dr. Vera Sandoval said. "But here's the thing—they're so focused on their next false announcement that security is light. They think we're trying to steal technology that doesn't exist."

"When actually we're documenting their fraud," Marcus said. "I like it. Much more believable than whatever they're claiming to have found this week."

Kit Salazar grinned. "My favorite was when they claimed the same site contained both 'immortality serum' and 'instant death rays.' To the same investor. In the same presentation."

"And people believed it?" Marcus asked.

"People believe what they want to believe," Dr. Park said. "Until someone shows them the accounting records."
