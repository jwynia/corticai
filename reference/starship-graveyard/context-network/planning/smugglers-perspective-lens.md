# The Smuggler's Perspective Lens

## Core Concept
Write the story as if documenting Han Solo and Chewbacca's experience during the galactic civil war - they're aware of the big events, but focused on their own survival, debts, and problems. The galaxy-changing events are just backdrop to their personal struggles.

## Marcus Patel's Priorities (In Order)
1. **Immediate survival** - avoiding arrest, finding food/shelter
2. **Financial stability** - paying debts, securing income
3. **Protecting his people** - keeping his crew safe and employed
4. **Professional pride** - doing good salvage work, maintaining reputation
5. **Justice for family** - exposing who killed his cousin (personal, not cosmic)

## What Marcus Cares About
- Making payments on time
- Having decent coffee and food
- Keeping his equipment functional
- His crew's wellbeing
- Getting the port shop contract
- Clearing his name enough to work
- Simple revenge on those who wronged him

## What Marcus Doesn't Care About
- Saving galactic civilization
- The philosophical implications of alien preservation networks
- Corporate power structures beyond how they affect him
- Grand mysteries of the universe
- Being a hero or leader of movements
- Transforming humanity's future

## Story Scale Guidelines

### ✅ Smuggler Scale (Good)
- One city/port/region
- 3-5 key locations max
- Personal transportation (his truck, maybe a shuttle)
- Debts measured in thousands, not millions
- 5-10 person crew
- Local corrupt officials
- Regional corporate office
- Crimes that affect dozens of people

### ❌ Galactic Scale (Avoid)
- Multiple star systems
- Dozens of locations
- Fleet movements
- Trillion-credit conspiracies
- Armies of supporters
- Sector-wide government corruption
- Corporate headquarters making species-wide decisions
- Crimes that affect billions

## Plot Focus

### Primary Story (Marcus's View)
- Corporate assholes destroyed my salvage yard
- They killed my cousin to cover up safety violations
- I need to expose them so I can work again
- Maybe I can get that port shop if I survive
- My crew needs paying work after this mess

### Background Events (Happening But Not Marcus's Problem)
- Vast alien preservation networks
- Corporate wars over archaeological sites
- Government investigations
- The fate of ancient civilizations
- The future of human evolution

## Dialogue Approach

### Marcus Should Say:
- "I just want to get paid and go home"
- "Not my problem - I fix ships, not civilizations"
- "Will this help me get the port contract?"
- "Can we afford that?"
- "I've got bills due tomorrow"

### Marcus Shouldn't Say:
- "We must save the Chorus legacy!"
- "The fate of humanity depends on us"
- "This changes everything we know about the universe"
- "We're making history"
- "Think of future generations"

## Resolution Types

### Smuggler Victories:
- Gets paid (or debt forgiven)
- Secures steady work
- Keeps crew together and safe
- Bad guy gets arrested for mundane crimes
- Returns to normal life (improved)
- Has better coffee and working equipment

### Avoid These Resolutions:
- Saves civilization
- Transforms humanity
- Becomes legendary hero
- Solves ancient mysteries
- Leads revolutionary movement
- Changes course of history

## The "Cantina Test"

Would Marcus tell this story in a port bar? If yes, it's the right scale:
- "So there I was, trying to make my yard payment..."
- "These corporate assholes burned down my shop..."
- "Had to steal their own comm equipment to expose them..."
- "Lost my yard but got a port contract out of it..."

If it sounds like this, it's too big:
- "I discovered the secret of an ancient civilization..."
- "The fate of the galaxy hung in the balance..."
- "I led the resistance against corporate tyranny..."
- "We transformed the future of humanity..."

## Implementation Checklist

Before writing any scene, ask:
1. What's Marcus's immediate problem? (rent/food/arrest)
2. How do the big events inconvenience him personally?
3. What's the cheapest/simplest solution he'd try?
4. How does this affect his next payment?
5. Would Han Solo care about this?

## The Bottom Line

Marcus is a working-class salvager who stumbled into corporate crimes. He wants to:
- Expose the criminals who killed his cousin
- Get back to making a living
- Keep his people safe
- Maybe upgrade from instant coffee to real beans

Everything else - alien civilizations, preservation networks, corporate wars, the future of humanity - is just background noise that makes his life complicated. He engages with it only as much as necessary to solve his immediate problems.

**Remember**: In Star Wars, Han shot Greedo over a bar tab, not to save the galaxy. That's the scale we're writing at.
