# Chapters 1-7 Audit - Identifying Issues to Fix

## Purpose
Systematic audit of Chapters 1-7 to identify naming problems, scale issues, convenience plotting, and other elements that need framework application.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Active
- **Abstraction:** Analysis
- **Confidence:** High

## Audit Methodology
For each chapter, identify:
1. Site naming issues (any "Gamma-12" style names)
2. Scale problems ("human space", impossible numbers)
3. Political simplifications ("human authorities")
4. Character harmony (lack of friction)
5. Convenience plotting
6. Villain behavior
7. Personal stakes absence

## Chapter 1 Audit

### Content Summary
Marcus at salvage yard with Rhea (AI partner), living in container home. Rhea has acquired an Oort Serval for salvage. Marcus gets offered a port spot opportunity by Quinnett.

### Issues Identified
1. **World-building**: References to generic "Commonwealth" (line 46)
2. **Character Stakes**: Marcus's financial situation needs more specificity
3. **Slight pulpiness**: "starship graveyard" framing in opening
4. **Politics**: Need to replace "Commonwealth" with specific jurisdiction

### Fixes Needed
- Replace "Commonwealth" with "CCC Regional Security protocols"
- Add specific financial pressure (loan balance, port spot cost of 25k)
- Ground Marcus's past more specifically (his arrest record, corporate security work)
- Consider toning down "starship graveyard" romanticism

## Chapter 2 Audit

### Content Summary
Marcus travels to Drayton Port to collect the Serval. Quinnett offers him the port spot (25k down payment). The Serval shows signs of hasty repairs and has military-grade encryption.

### Issues Identified
1. **World-building**: References to "human traffic" vs other species (line 134)
2. **Character Development**: Marcus's past dreams of exploration ships feel generic
3. **Corporate Reality**: Needs more bureaucratic process around port operations
4. **Scale**: Travel times and distances need grounding

### Fixes Needed
- Replace "human traffic" with multi-species commerce references
- Add specific financial calculations Marcus makes about the port spot
- Show more paperwork/bureaucracy in port operations
- Ground the Crux interaction more specifically

## Chapter 3 Audit

### Content Summary
Marcus attempts to break into the encrypted Serval, finds Dr. Reeves's body and Chorus artifact. Detective Oriz arrives suspiciously quickly. The artifact recognizes Marcus due to his long exposure to Chorus-touched salvage.

### Issues Identified
1. **Major Issue**: Still heavily focused on consciousness technology themes
2. **Convenience**: The biometric lock recognizing Marcus feels too convenient
3. **World-building**: References to "human civilization" (line 159)
4. **Scale**: "Treaty of Spheres" implies galactic-scale politics

### Fixes Needed
- Major rewrite needed to shift from consciousness tech to financial fraud discovery
- Replace consciousness themes with authentication/fraud evidence
- Make the lock recognition more grounded (Reeves programmed it for Marcus specifically)
- Replace "human civilization" with regional archaeological dating
- Replace "Treaty of Spheres" with "Proxima Archaeological Accord"

## Chapter 4 Audit

### Content Summary
Marcus dealing with aftermath of finding Reeves's body. Detective Oriz interviews him. Discovery of financial fraud evidence in modified Crux artifacts. Corporate pressure from Stellarion. Decision to work with Oriz.

### Status
✓ Completed rewrite focusing on financial/archaeological crimes
✓ Successfully shifted from consciousness tech to fraud investigation
✓ Corporate behavior appropriately bureaucratic (Catherine Morgue)

### Remaining Issues
1. **Site Names**: References to "Site Gamma-7", "Site Delta-3", "Site Beta-9" throughout
2. **Scale**: "Across seventeen sites? Conservative estimate is 2.3 billion credits" needs adjustment
3. **Character Friction**: Team works too smoothly together
4. **References**: Some mentions of consciousness tech remain (lines 420-421)

### Specific Fixes Needed
- "Site Gamma-7" → "Ross 128b Site 9 (Stellarion Survey 2388)"
- "Site Delta-3" → "Proxima Centauri b Site 3 (Henderson Deep Core 2386)"
- "Site Beta-9" → "Wolf 359c Site 1 (Initial Survey 2385)"
- Adjust fraud scale from 17 sites/2.3B to 8 sites/800M initially
- Add friction between Marcus and Oriz (trust issues)
- Remove remaining consciousness bridging references

## Chapter 5 Audit

### Content Summary
Meeting Dr. Vera Sandoval at safe house. Learning about the financial fraud pattern. Corporate pressure escalates. Introduction to underground network of researchers documenting fraud.

### Status
✓ Completed rewrite focusing on financial fraud
✓ Successfully explains pump-and-dump scheme
✓ Good bureaucratic evil (Catherine Morgue's threats)

### Remaining Issues
1. **Site Names**: "Site Gamma-7", "Site Delta-3", "Gamma-12" references
2. **Scale**: "sixty sites destroyed, 4.7 billion" (line 165) needs reduction
3. **Character Development**: Dr. Sandoval's personal stakes unclear
4. **Team Size**: "Maybe thirty people documenting" feels too organized

### Specific Fixes Needed
- All site names need proper designation system
- Reduce from 60 sites/4.7B to 8 sites/1.2B 
- Add personal cost for Dr. Sandoval (family pressure, career destruction)
- Reduce network to "maybe a dozen people" for more desperate feel
- "Site Beta-9" → proper name with discovery credit

## Chapter 6 Audit

### Content Summary
Journey to Gamma-12 through Scatter Belt. Authentication training. Ship AI corruption from war damage. 

### Status
✓ Completed rewrite removing consciousness technology
✓ Focus on authentication and evidence gathering
✓ Good tension with damaged ship systems

### Remaining Issues
1. **Site Names**: "Gamma-12", "Site Beta-9", generic references throughout
2. **Scale**: "At least sixty confirmed" sites (line 84)
3. **Character Friction**: Team still too harmonious during crisis
4. **War References**: "Independence War" needs grounding in regional conflict

### Specific Fixes Needed
- Replace all "Gamma-12" with "Kepler-442c Site 7"
- "Site Beta-9" → "Wolf 359c Site 1 (Patel-Reeves Joint 2385)"
- Reduce site count from 60 to 8
- Add friction during ship malfunction (blame, stress responses)
- Make Independence War more specific (CCC vs Frontier Coalition)
- Add personal costs accumulating (Marcus checking messages about yard)

## Chapter 7 Audit

### Content Summary
Infiltrating archaeological site - recently drafted and revised.

### Status
✓ Recently written with frameworks in mind
✓ Incorporated art crime/money laundering

### Remaining Issues
- "Gamma-12" throughout → "Kepler-442c Site 7"
- "Eighty-three sites" → "Eight sites"
- Some convenience in evidence discovery
- Team too harmonious under pressure

### Specific Fixes Needed
Throughout chapter:
- Replace all "Gamma-12" with "Kepler-442c Site 7" or "The Harmonic Chambers"
- Change Trizik's "eighty-three sites" to "eight sites"
- Add friction between team members during infiltration
- Show personal costs accumulating (Marcus checking messages about lost contracts)

## Cross-Chapter Consistency Issues

### Site Naming
Need systematic replacement:
- "Gamma-12" → "Kepler-442c Site 7 (Reeves 2387)" or "The Harmonic Chambers"
- "Site Delta-9" → "Tau Ceti e Site 12 (Meridian Excavation 2390)" or "The Healing Confluence"
- "Site Beta-7" → "Wolf 359c Site 1 (Patel-Reeves Joint 2385)" or "The Memory Palace"
- "Site Gamma-7" → "Ross 128b Site 9 (Stellarion Survey 2388)" or "The Temporal Observatory"

### Political References
Replace throughout:
- "Human space" → "CCC territory" or "Proxima Sector"
- "Human authorities" → "CCC Regional Security" or specific jurisdiction
- "Galactic" anything → "Regional" or "Sector"

### Scale Adjustments
- Total destroyed sites: 83 → 8 over 4 years
- Criminal proceeds: 40+ billion → 4 billion
- Geographic scope: Galactic → Proxima Sector (5 star systems)
- Timeline: Compressed → 7-year corporate evolution

### Character Development
Add throughout earlier chapters:
- Specific financial pressures (bills, contract losses)
- Family concerns where applicable
- Professional reputation stakes
- Accumulating stress indicators

## Priority Fixes

### Immediate (Chapter 7)
1. Global replace "Gamma-12" with proper naming
2. Fix Trizik's site count (83 → 8)
3. Add character friction during stress
4. Show accumulating personal costs

### High Priority (Chapters 5-6)
1. Fix site naming consistency
2. Adjust scale references
3. Add personal stakes to character reactions
4. Ensure bureaucratic evil (not cartoon villainy)

### Medium Priority (Chapters 1-3)
1. World-building consistency
2. Political structure references
3. Character motivation grounding
4. Early stakes establishment

## Summary of Major Issues Across All Chapters

### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fix
1. **Site Naming**: Generic "Gamma-12" style names throughout all chapters
2. **Scale Problems**: References to 60-83 sites and 4.7 billion (should be 8 sites, 1.2-4 billion)
3. **Political Structure**: "Commonwealth", "human space", "human civilization" references
4. **Chapter 3**: Still heavily consciousness-focused, needs major revision

### Widespread Issues
1. **Character Friction**: Teams work too harmoniously under pressure
2. **Personal Stakes**: Characters need more specific losses (financial, family, career)
3. **Bureaucratic Process**: Need more paperwork, committees, corporate euphemisms
4. **Regional Grounding**: Replace galactic references with Proxima Sector specifics

## Implementation Strategy - Revised Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Chapter 3 Rewrite
1. Shift from consciousness technology to financial fraud discovery
2. Make biometric lock recognition logical (Reeves programmed it)
3. Replace all consciousness themes with authentication/evidence
4. Update political references

### Phase 2: Global Find/Replace (All Chapters)
1. Site names using the naming system
2. Political terms ("Commonwealth" → "CCC", etc.)
3. Scale numbers (60-83 → 8, 4.7B → 1.2-4B)
4. "Human" political entities → specific jurisdictions

### Phase 3: Character Enhancement Pass
1. Add friction in Chapters 4-7 team scenes
2. Insert personal cost references throughout
3. Add specific financial pressures in Chapters 1-2
4. Show accumulating stress (checking messages, physical symptoms)

### Phase 4: World-building Consistency
1. Add bureaucratic processes to corporate scenes
2. Ground war references (Independence War → CCC-Frontier conflict)
3. Verify all geographic references use Proxima Sector
4. Add committee-speak to villain dialogue

### Phase 5: Final Consistency Check
1. Verify all site names match system
2. Confirm scale consistency (8 sites over 7 years)
3. Check character arcs show degradation
4. Ensure bureaucratic evil throughout

## Search Patterns for Common Issues

### Site Names to Replace
- "Gamma-12"
- "Site [Greek letter]-[number]"
- Any similar pattern

### Political Terms to Update
- "human space"
- "human authorities"  
- "galactic" (when referring to scope)
- "humanity" (when meaning political entity)

### Scale Indicators to Check
- Number of destroyed sites
- Financial figures
- Geographic scope
- Timeline references

### Character Harmony Red Flags
- "Everyone agreed"
- "The team worked perfectly"
- No disagreement in high-stress scenes
- Unanimous decisions without debate

## Success Metrics

### Properly Fixed Chapter Should Have:
- [ ] Realistic site naming using full system
- [ ] Regional scope (not galactic)
- [ ] Character friction under pressure
- [ ] Personal stakes visible
- [ ] Bureaucratic evil (not cartoon)
- [ ] Believable scale (8 sites, 4 billion)

## Next Steps

1. Read Chapters 1-3 to complete audit
2. Create specific fix list for each chapter
3. Implement changes systematically
4. Verify consistency across all chapters
5. Final read-through for missed issues
