# Chapter 4 - Scene 2: Discovery (Revised for Crime/Corruption Focus)

## Scene 2: Discovery

"Well, that could have gone better," Rhea said after Detective Morgan Oriz's police cruiser disappeared down the access road.

Marcus was still standing in his office doorway, staring at the empty space where the detective had been. "She thinks Vasquez is involved."

"Or she thinks you think Vasquez is involved. Police interviews often work in layers."

"What's that supposed to mean?"

"It means she's testing theories. Yours and hers." Rhea's voice took on the particular tone she used when she was switching into problem-solving mode. "What did you think of her?"

Marcus walked back to his desk and slumped into his chair. "I think she knows more than she's saying. And I think those modified Crux artifacts are going to be a problem."

"So what do we do?"

The question hung in the air between them. Marcus knew what the smart play was. Keep his head down, answer questions when asked, let the police handle the investigation. Maybe salvage the port spot opportunity if Quinnett was feeling generous. Go back to his comfortable life of fixing old ships and not thinking too hard about where they came from.

But those modified artifacts kept nagging at him. The way they shimmered with that familiar resonance—the same shimmer he'd been seeing in salvage for years. And Dr. Reeves had been patient with a screwed-up kid once, tried to help him understand that some things mattered more than profit.

"I want to look at those artifacts again," Marcus said finally.

"Marcus—"

"I know what you're going to say. I know this is stupid. I know I should stay out of it." He stood up, heading for the door. "But those artifacts aren't standard Crux tech. Someone modified them, and I want to know why."

Rhea was quiet for a moment. When she spoke again, her voice was carefully neutral. "The ship's logs are still encrypted."

"I know."

"Pandora-level encryption. The kind that usually protects things that can get people killed."

"I know that too." Marcus paused at the door. "But maybe the artifacts will tell us something the logs won't."

"Marcus." Rhea's voice carried a warning. "Once we start analyzing experimental technology, there's no pretending we're just innocent salvagers who happened to find a body."

Marcus thought about Detective Morgan Oriz's questions about Vasquez. About the way she'd said "piece on the board." About Reeves's patient voice twenty years ago, trying to help a screwed-up kid understand that the shimmer in salvage meant something important.

"I don't think we get to pretend that anyway."

"All right." Rhea's voice took on the focused quality it got when she was switching to analysis mode. "Let me run a full scan on those artifacts while you examine them physically."

Marcus headed out to the ship. The modified Crux artifacts were still where he'd found them, tucked behind false panels in what should have been standard cargo space. But up close, with better lighting, he could see the modifications more clearly. Someone had attached data storage modules to the standard crystalline matrix—not biological components, but high-density quantum storage.

"Marcus," Rhea said after a few minutes of scanning, "these aren't just modified artifacts. They're data cores disguised as artifacts."

"Data cores?"

"The crystalline structure is real Crux tech, but it's been hollowed out and fitted with storage modules. Someone was using authentic artifacts as camouflage for data smuggling."

Marcus felt his stomach drop. "What kind of data?"

"Financial records. Site surveys. Geological assessments. Marcus, this is a complete documentation of archaeological sites across three sectors." Rhea paused. "And there's something else. I found reference files in the ship's secondary systems."

"What kind of reference files?"

"Site destruction orders. They're calling it 'Project Excavation.' And Marcus..." Rhea's voice took on the cautious tone she used when she'd figured out something she wasn't sure he wanted to hear. "There are detailed financial projections for each site."

"Financial projections?"

"Stock price impacts. Market manipulation timelines. They're not just destroying sites—they're timing the destructions to maximize profit from market movements. Announce a 'revolutionary discovery,' stock goes up. Destroy the site claiming 'safety concerns,' short the stock on the way down. Marcus, these sites... seventeen of them are listed as 'harvested' with profit margins noted."

Marcus stared at the modified artifact in his hands. The data modules blinked with activity lights, recording everything. "How much money are we talking about?"

"Across seventeen sites? Conservative estimate is 2.3 billion credits in market manipulation alone. That's not counting whatever they're selling from the sites themselves." Rhea paused. "Marcus, I think Dr. Reeves wasn't trying to steal this data. I think he was documenting evidence."

"What makes you think that?"

"The file structure. It's organized like a legal brief, not a business plan. Cross-referenced with preservation laws, treaty violations, documented false claims to investors. And there's a partial audio file."

Marcus felt a chill run down his spine. "Can you play it?"

"It's fragmentary, but I'll clean it up as much as possible."

The audio that came through the ship's speakers was distorted, full of static, but Dr. Reeves's voice was unmistakable: "...cannot allow this to continue. The systematic destruction of Chorus sites for stock manipulation violates every financial regulation and preservation law. Stellarion's rotating claims about what they've found—consciousness tech to one division, weapons to another, energy sources to investors—it's all lies. I have documented evidence of coordinated market manipulation across twelve sites. They're not revolutionizing technology; they're running a multi-billion credit con game. I am transmitting this record to..."

The recording cut off in a burst of static.

"Marcus," Rhea said quietly, "I think we found our motive for murder."

Marcus stood there in the cargo hold, holding the disguised data core, feeling its weight in his hands. "So he was trying to expose financial crimes."

"It looks that way. Stellarion has been claiming different 'revolutionary discoveries' at each site, pumping the stock, then destroying the evidence before anyone can verify their claims. Classic pump and dump, but with archaeological sites."

"And they're getting away with it because no one can verify what was actually at the sites."

"Exactly." Rhea's voice carried a note of urgency. "Marcus, I'm detecting vehicles approaching the yard. Multiple signatures, moving in formation. And I just received a priority message from Detective Morgan Oriz."

Marcus felt his blood turn to ice. "Police?"

"Negative. These aren't showing law enforcement transponder codes. They're running corporate signatures."

Marcus looked at the data core in his hands, then at the hidden compartment where he'd found it. Twenty years ago, Dr. Reeves had tried to help him understand that some knowledge came with a price. Now that knowledge was about to exact its cost.

"How long do we have?"

"Two minutes, maybe three before they reach the main gate."

Marcus made his choice. Not the heroic choice or the smart choice—just the choice he could live with. "Upload everything to Detective Oriz. Full data dump. And Rhea?"

"Yes?"

"What's the message from Oriz?"

"She says she's been investigating Stellarion's financial crimes for six months. Corporate vehicles approaching your location means you're either about to be arrested on false charges or about to disappear. She's dispatching backup, but they're twenty minutes out."

Marcus felt his blood run cold. "Twenty minutes?"

"She says to document everything and don't let them take you anywhere. If they try, resist and make noise. She also says..." Rhea paused. "She says if they offer you money to stay quiet, that's conspiracy to commit fraud. Get them to name a number on recording if you can."

Marcus almost smiled despite the situation. Detective Oriz was thinking like a financial crimes investigator. Good. That meant she understood what they were really dealing with—not alien consciousness technology, but good old-fashioned corporate greed dressed up in archaeological mystique.
