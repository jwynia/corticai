# Crime/Corruption Focus - Comprehensive Ripple Revision Plan

## Purpose
Maps all changes needed to transform the story from consciousness/alien-tech focus to archaeological crime/corporate corruption with self-aware characters who recognize sci-fi tropes.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Overview of Required Changes

### Core Transformation
**FROM**: Magical alien consciousness technology
**TO**: Corporate crime coverup using rotating mythologies about artifacts

### Key Principles
1. Characters are skeptical of grandiose claims
2. Multiple false narratives exist simultaneously
3. The real crime is destruction of heritage sites
4. Corporate greed drives everything
5. Truth is more mundane but more damaging than fiction

## Chapter-by-Chapter Revision Map

### Chapter 1: Discovery
**Current**: Marcus finds mysterious body with strange artifacts
**Minimal Changes Needed**: 
- Keep as-is mostly
- Add subtle hints of Marcus's skepticism about "miracle salvage"
- Rhea could comment on how many "ancient alien tech" scams she's seen

**Key Addition**: 
```
"Another derelict claiming to have 'revolutionary technology aboard'," Rhea noted. "Third one this month."
"Let me guess," Marcus replied. "Ancient alien power sources?"
"Close. 'Xenoarchaeological specimens of unprecedented value.'"
"So... weird rocks."
```

### Chapter 2: Disturbance
**Current**: Stellarion shows interest in artifacts
**Revision Needs**:
- Stellarion rep makes vague claims about "proprietary technology"
- Refuses to specify what the technology supposedly does
- Marcus notices they're more interested in stopping investigation than recovering artifacts

**New Scene Focus**: Corporate intimidation tactics, legal threats

### Chapter 3: Hidden Cargo
**Current**: Marcus discovers special artifacts
**Major Revision**:
- Artifacts are clearly data storage but nothing obviously magical
- Dr. Vera Sandoval is introduced as skeptical archaeologist
- She's tracking pattern of site destruction across sector
- Vincent Webb claims artifacts are various things to different people

**Key Change**: Dr. Sandoval shows Marcus how Stellarion's story keeps changing

### Chapter 4: Pursuit
**Current**: Discovery about consciousness technology
**Complete Rewrite Needed**:
- Focus on financial records showing site destruction pattern
- Detective Morgan Oriz investigating financial crimes, not alien tech
- Kit Salazar revealed as archaeological crimes specialist
- Discovery of systematic destruction for profit

### Chapter 5: Revelation
**Current**: Consciousness bridging explanation
**Complete Rewrite**:
- Dr. Vera Sandoval explains the corporate scam
- Shows how different divisions claim different properties
- Evidence of stock manipulation based on "discoveries"
- Dr. Emil Reeves killed for documenting the pattern

**New Core**: The conspiracy to control archaeological narrative

### Chapter 6: Approach
**Current**: Consciousness harvesting operation
**Complete Rewrite**:
- Approaching site expecting corporate security
- Finding evidence of systematic stripping operation
- Real danger is mercenaries and legal consequences
- Discovery of what's really being hidden

### Chapters 7-12: Investigation Deepens
**Framework**:
- Unraveling layers of corporate deception
- Each chapter reveals different false narrative
- Building legal/media case against Stellarion
- Race to preserve evidence before destruction

## Worldbuilding Adjustments

- Nothing magical, but historically valuable
- Multiple interpretations of same evidence

### Archaeological Sites
**Old**: Contain consciousness-altering technology
**New**: Contain evidence that corporations want hidden

### Corporate Structure
**New Elements**:

- Different divisions selling different stories
- Stock manipulation through "discovery" announcements
- Legal teams destroying sites to prevent investigation

## New Plot Structure

### Act 1: Discovery and Skepticism
- Chapters 1-3: Marcus finds body, corporate pressure, meets skeptical allies
- Central question: Why does Stellarion care so much?

### Act 2: Investigation and Revelation
- Chapters 4-8: Uncovering the pattern of destruction
- Multiple false narratives exposed
- Building understanding of real crime

### Act 3: Race Against Destruction
- Chapters 9-12: Preventing final site destruction
- Exposing conspiracy
- Legal/media battle

## Dialogue Philosophy

### Before
```
"This technology could revolutionize human consciousness!"
"The Chorus left us the key to transcendence!"
"We must unlock these ancient secrets!"
```

### After
```
"According to this week's investor report, it's time travel. Last month it was immortality."
"The Chorus left us... honestly? Probably just their garbage."
"We must document these sites before they're bulldozed for quarterly earnings."
```

## Key Scenes to Add

### The Mythology Meeting
- Corporate boardroom where they decide what this week's story is
- Marketing presenting focus group results
- "Consciousness transfer tested poorly with the 35-49 demographic"

### The Pattern Revelation
- Maya shows Marcus how destruction follows stock price needs
- Sites destroyed right before quarterly reports
- "Discovery" announcements timed to merger deals

### The Real Evidence
- What Emerson actually found: previous corporate coverup
- Sites contain records of failed colony Stellarion wants hidden
- The "Chorus" narrative itself is corporate fabrication

## Implementation Priority

1. Rewrite Chapters 5-6 completely
2. Revise Chapter 4 for new direction
