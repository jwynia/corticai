### Key Documents Created

#### Core Vision Documents
- `/context-network/planning/blue-collar-noir-core-vision.md` - Foundational tone guide
- `/context-network/planning/smugglers-perspective-lens.md` - Han Solo perspective framework
- `/context-network/planning/comprehensive-revision-plan.md` - Guided major revisions

- `/context-network/revisions/character-name-revision-plan.md` - Naming diversity fixes

### Major Achievements

#### Maintained Core Vision
- Blue-collar protagonist with financial pressures
- No mystical elements or consciousness technology  
- Personal stakes over cosmic significance
- Practical solutions to technical problems
- Working-class voice throughout

#### Avoided LLM Pitfalls
- Resisted consciousness/transformation plot drift
- Prevented scale creep to galactic implications
- Avoided "chosen one" narrative
- Maintained consistent character voices
- Kept technology industrial, not mystical

### What's Next

#### Immediate Tasks
1. Line editing pass for consistency
2. Final name/term consistency check
3. Prose polish for voice consistency
4. Format for beta readers

#### Future Considerations
- Potential sequel: "PPS and the Frontier" (teased in epilogue)
- The "LISTENING" mystery
- Kellerman's World and metal-eating wildlife
- What the preservation sites really want

### Key Lessons Learned

1. **Strong vision documents prevent drift** - Blue-collar noir and smuggler's lens kept story grounded
2. **Regular reviews catch problems early** - Chapter-by-chapter reviews prevented major structural issues
3. **LLMs drift toward certain patterns** - Consciousness, chosen ones, galactic scale need active resistance
4. **Character naming needs deliberate diversity** - Default patterns cluster around "safe" choices
5. **Less can be more** - 38 chapters instead of 40 provided better pacing
