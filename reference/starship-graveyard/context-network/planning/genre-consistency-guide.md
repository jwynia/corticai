# Genre Consistency Guide - Archaeological Thriller

## Classification
- Domain: Planning/Writing Strategy
- Stability: Static (core principles established)
- Abstraction: Practical (specific implementation guidance)
- Confidence: Established (proven through successful revision)

## Core Genre: Blue-Collar Archaeological Thriller

### Key Elements to Maintain
1. **Corporate Crime Focus**: Greed, fraud, evidence destruction
2. **Working-Class Perspective**: Financial struggles, practical concerns
3. **Archaeological Preservation**: Sites as valuable artifacts, not mystical entities
4. **Technical Explanations**: Advanced but non-sentient technology
5. **Human-Scale Stakes**: Justice, survival, preservation (not cosmic destiny)

## Character Perspective Requirements

### Marcus Patel - The Skeptical Anchor
- **Always Skeptical**: Immediately suspects practical explanations
- **Technical Expertise**: From salvage work, not mystical ability
- **Blue-Collar Pragmatism**: "There's always a practical explanation"
- **No Special Abilities**: Just experience and pattern recognition

### Other Characters
- **Can Believe Mystical**: Creates contrast with Marcus
- **Eventually Proven Wrong**: Marcus's skepticism validated
- **Serves Plot**: Their beliefs drive conflict/investigation

## Common LLM Drift Patterns to Avoid

### Consciousness Technology Drift
- **Avoid**: Mind transfer, consciousness preservation, neural interfaces
- **Replace With**: Data theft, forced decryption, system overloading

### Mystical Sensitivity Drift
- **Avoid**: Special connection, resonance, chosen one narrative
- **Replace With**: Technical skill, experience, pattern recognition

### First Contact Drift
- **Avoid**: Sentient sites, alien communication, cosmic tests
- **Replace With**: Automated systems, technical malfunctions, data archives

### Cosmic Stakes Drift
- **Avoid**: Humanity's destiny, existential threats, consciousness evolution
- **Replace With**: Corporate accountability, worker safety, cultural preservation
