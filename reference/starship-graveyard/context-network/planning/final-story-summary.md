# Starship Graveyard - Final Story Summary

## One-Line Summary
A blue-collar salvager's discovery of a murdered corpo in a locked ship pulls him into exposing corporate archaeological crimes while trying to save his debt-ridden business.

## The Core Story (As Written)

### Beginning
Marcus Patel runs a struggling salvage yard, living in a converted shipping container and making monthly payments on a business worth less than he owes. When his AI partner Rhea alerts him to a bargain ship (the Oort Serval), he discovers a murdered corporate spy inside, along with evidence of a conspiracy involving illegal archaeological exploitation.

### Middle
Forced to investigate to clear his name, Marcus uncovers two corporations (Stellarion and FAC) systematically destroying Chorus preservation sites—alien archaeological archives—for profit. The sites contain 60,000 years of alien history being melted down for rare minerals. When Marcus refuses to help FAC, they burn down his salvage yard. He and his crew (Jake and Kit) must expose the conspiracy while being hunted by corporate mercenaries and criminal syndicates.

### End
Marcus discovers his practical, blue-collar approach to technology allows him to interface with preservation sites that academic experts can't crack. He stabilizes the archaeological network, preventing massive data loss. FAC's Director Solari is arrested trying to sell Marcus to the Yamazaki Syndicate. With his name cleared and compensation received, Marcus and his crew start Patel Preservation Services, helping legitimate researchers access sites without destroying them.

## Key Themes Preserved

### Blue-Collar Noir
- Financial pressure drives every decision
- Working-class protagonist vs. corporate power
- Practical skills trump academic expertise
- Victory costs everything but provides new beginning

### No Mystical Elements
- Preservation sites are advanced databases, not consciousness vessels
- Marcus has experience and expertise, not special powers
- Corporate crimes are greed-based, not cosmic evil
- Technology is industrial and comprehensible

### Personal Stakes
- Marcus wants to: pay bills, save his business, protect his crew
- Never tries to save civilization or transform humanity
- Success means getting his life back, not becoming a hero
- Ends with small business ownership, not galactic importance

## Character Arcs

### Marcus Patel
- Starts: Isolated salvager drowning in debt
- Ends: Small business owner working with partners
- Growth: Learns to trust others, values preservation over profit

### Rhea (AI Partner)
- Maintains boundaries and independence throughout
- Not a mystical consciousness, just a business partner
- Relationship stays complex and professional

### Jake (Jek Portside) & Kit (Kitra Threegen)
- From employees to partners
- Each contributes unique skills (Jake: practical, Kit: documentation)
- Crew loyalty based on mutual debts and respect

## What Makes It Different

### The Smuggler's Perspective
Like Han Solo's view of Star Wars, Marcus sees galaxy-changing events as background to personal problems. Preservation sites containing ancient knowledge matter less than making rent. Corporate conspiracies are just another obstacle to running a business.

### Pragmatic Solutions
- No chosen one destiny
- No transformative technology
- No unity of opposing factions
- Just exposing crimes and starting over

### Scale
Everything happens in one port city and surrounding region. The fate of 5 archaeological sites, not galactic civilization. Dozens of lives affected, not billions.

## Sequel Potential
The epilogue establishes:
- PPS as successful but seeking new challenges
- Frontier preservation sites with unknown dangers
- The sites themselves becoming active ("LISTENING")
- Metal-eating wildlife and other frontier hazards

But the story stands complete without requiring continuation.
