# Chapter 7 Revision Notes - Serious Sci-Fi Mystery Approach

## Core Tone Adjustment

### From:
- Comedic fraud discovery ("movie props with asset tags")
- Cartoon villains joking about murder
- Slapstick security incompetence
- Winking genre awareness

### To:
- Serious financial crime investigation
- Cold corporate efficiency in destruction
- Competent security that must be cleverly overcome
- Characters who are intelligent without being quippy

## Key Changes Needed

### 1. The Prop Warehouse → Evidence of Systematic Destruction
Instead of funny movie props, find:
- Sophisticated forgeries that could fool most inspectors
- Evidence of careful, methodical site stripping
- Documentation showing they studied each site before destruction
- Tools specifically designed to extract Chorus technology

The horror isn't that they used cheap props—it's that they knew exactly what they were destroying and did it anyway.

### 2. The Executive Video → Cold Corporate Planning
Replace joking about murder with:
- Dispassionate discussion of "risk mitigation"
- Dr. Reeves referred to as "the liability"
- Focus on quarterly projections and shareholder value
- The banality of evil, not cartoon villainy

### 3. Trizik's Character → Traumatized Witness
Less "satisfied revelation" and more:
- Genuine trauma from witnessing cultural destruction
- Desperate to preserve what evidence remains
- Anger tempered by grief
- Professional archaeologist who's seen their life's work destroyed

### 4. The Site's Assistance → Mechanical Systems
Replace mystical "asking for help" with:
- Marcus understanding the site's automated systems
- Using his resonance sensitivity to activate dormant functions
- Clear mechanical cause and effect
- The site isn't "aware"—it's well-designed

### 5. Security Response → Professional Threat
- Competent guards following intelligent protocols
- They know the team is there from the start
- Cat and mouse game through the facility
- Escape requires genuine cleverness, not luck

## Dialogue Tone Shift

### Before:
"Same chrome sphere, different revolutionary discovery!"
"They're idiots. Complete idiots."
"Let me guess—immortality pods?"

### After:
"The forgeries are sophisticated. Most archaeologists wouldn't spot them."
"They documented everything. They knew exactly what they were destroying."
"The efficiency is what's terrifying. They've industrialized cultural extinction."

## Character Adjustments

### Marcus
- Less quippy, more professionally angry
- Salvager's problem-solving without jokes
- Genuine awe at real Chorus architecture
- Grief for his murdered mentor

### Kit Salazar
- Professional investigator documenting evidence
- Satisfaction in building an airtight case
- Anger at the scale of destruction
- No banter during evidence gathering

### Dr. Vera Sandoval
- Focused data extraction
- Horror at the systematic nature
- Professional competence without celebration
- Understanding the legal implications

### Kess Trizik
- Traumatized survivor, not clever revealer
- Desperate to save evidence
- Grief-stricken but determined
- Professional archaeologist, not exposition device

## Scene Flow Adjustments

### Scene 1: Infiltration
- Tense, careful entry
- Marvel at genuine Chorus architecture
- Professional assessment of Stellarion modifications
- Discovery of systematic stripping operation

### Scene 2: Documentation
- Methodical evidence gathering
- Growing horror at the scale
- Realization this isn't simple fraud—it's cultural genocide
- Professional anger, not jokes

### Scene 3: Finding Trizik
- A traumatized colleague, not a clever ally
- Desperate preservation efforts
- Evidence gathered at great personal cost
- The weight of being sole witness

### Scene 4: Data Extraction
- Race against competent security
- Difficult choices about what to save
- Partial success requiring follow-up
- Escape that costs something

## What This Preserves

- Characters are still intelligent and competent
- The crime is still financial/archaeological fraud
- Evidence gathering remains the focus
- Genre awareness exists but isn't comedic

## What This Changes

- Tone: serious investigation, not caper
- Stakes: cultural genocide, not just money
- Villains: competent and cold, not buffoonish
- Success: difficult and partial, not convenient

## The Core Emotion

Instead of "satisfied revelation," the chapter should evoke:
- Professional anger at systematic destruction
- Awe at what's being lost
- Determination despite overwhelming odds
- Grief for destroyed heritage

This is a chapter about discovering the true scope of a horrible crime, not cleverly exposing silly villains.
