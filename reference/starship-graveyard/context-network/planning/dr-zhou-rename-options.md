```
Marcus: "Vera? That's an old Earth name, isn't it?"
Vera: "Everything's an old Earth name if you trace it back far enough. Mine just happens to mean 'truth' - rather inconvenient in my line of work."
"How so?"
"Try getting corporate funding when your name literally means you can't be bought."
```
