# Chapter 3: The Locked Ship - Refined Plan

## Purpose
Refined planning for Chapter 3 that avoids weak mystery patterns and implements strong, concrete storytelling.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Process
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established

## Content

### Chapter Arc
**Story Circle Position:** Transition from Stage 1 (YOU) to Stage 2 (NEED)
- Marcus's expertise is challenged by unprecedented security
- Professional pride drives active investigation
- Discovery forces immediate, life-changing decisions

### Scene 1: Professional Challenge

**Opening Hook:**
Marcus runs his standard diagnostic sweep on the Serval. The readout shows power draw from systems that shouldn't exist on a cargo vessel—quantum processors rated for military-grade encryption, drawing 3.7 terawatts.

**Rising Action:**
- Marcus attacks the problem systematically:
  - Thermal lance (melts before touching hull—reactive armor)
  - EMP burst (ship's Faraday cage rating exceeds anything civilian)
  - Rhea's code injection (firewall identifies and destroys her probe)
- Each failure reveals specific technical impossibilities
- Port contract deadline: 72 hours remaining

**Turning Point:**
Rhea detects the ship's security is running a countdown. Not a self-destruct—a beacon activation. Someone will come looking in 18 hours.

**Scene Close:**
Marcus makes the call: "We crack this thing now, or we push it into the desert and pretend we never saw it." His hands are already reaching for the plasma cutter.

### Scene 2: Technical Victory

**Opening:**
Marcus jury-rigs a frequency scanner from three different salvaged systems. The ship's hull resonates at 14.7 kHz—a manufacturing flaw in this model's ablative coating.

**Rising Action:**
- Exploiting the resonance creates a 6-inch breach
- Security system releases targeted neurotoxin (Marcus barely seals his suit in time)
- Manual override panel revealed behind false bulkhead
- Manifest shows: "Cargo: Industrial Lubricants, 400 tons"
- Ship's actual mass: 387 tons
- 13-ton discrepancy

**Turning Point:**
Hidden compartment's lock uses Marcus's old MIT student ID algorithm—impossible coincidence.

**Scene Close:**
The lock recognizes his biometric signature from twenty years ago. Click.

### Scene 3: No Going Back

**Opening:**
Compartment contains:
- Crux bio-pod (temperature: -4°C, preserving something)
- Human body in expensive suit, archaeological site coordinates on tablet still glowing
- Blood spatter pattern indicates execution, not accident

**Rising Action:**
- Marcus recognizes the encryption pattern—Dr. Emerson's proprietary archaeological database
- Victim's hand clutches data shard labeled "SITES MANIFEST"
- Bio-pod's display shows Crux biological signatures—but corrupted
- Port security alert: "Salvage vessel Patel-1, prepare for inspection"

**Climax:**
Marcus touches the data shard. It activates, projecting a 3-second hologram: Dr. Emerson's face, terrified, saying "Marcus, they're destroying the sites. The evidence is—" before cutting to static.

**Falling Action:**
- Delete security footage or preserve evidence?
- Hide the body or report it?
- Three police skimmers approaching, ETA 4 minutes

**Scene Close:**
Marcus pockets the shard. "Rhea, wipe everything from the last hour. We found an empty ship with a broken lock. Nothing else." His hands shake as he initiates emergency cleanup protocols. The comfortable life he built on forgetting the past just ended.

### Concrete Mystery Elements

**Professional Stakes:**
- Salvage license revocation
- Criminal investigation given his record
- Port contract opportunity destroyed
- Financial ruin from legal fees

**Technical Mysteries:**
- Why does 20-year-old MIT security recognize Marcus?
- What is a Crux bio-pod doing on a human cargo ship?
- How did victim get Dr. Emerson's encrypted site database?
- Who added military encryption to a civilian vessel?

**Active Choices:**
- Marcus chooses each breach method based on expertise
- Decides to continue despite beacon warning  
- Chooses to hide evidence rather than come clean
- Takes the shard knowing it implicates him

### Sensory/Concrete Details
- Quantum processor hum (subsonic vibration felt in bones)
- Neurotoxin smell (bitter almonds through suit filters)
- Bio-pod frost patterns (crystalline Crux script)
- Blood spatter (arterial spray, 2.3m arc)
- Hologram flicker (cyan-shifted, degrading data)

### Bridge to Chapter 4
- Police arriving with specific questions about Dr. Emerson
- Rhea discovering the shard contains quantum-encrypted data
- Marcus realizing someone wanted HIM specifically to find this
- 17 hours until beacon activation
