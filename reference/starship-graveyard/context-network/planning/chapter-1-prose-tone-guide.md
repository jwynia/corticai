## Chapter-by-Chapter Tone Check

2. **Are the financial pressures still present?**
3. **Do relationships have realistic friction?**
4. **Is technology explained practically?**
5. **Are problems solved through expertise?**
6. **Does dialogue feel natural?**
7. **Are details serving character development?**
8. **Is the voice still conversational?**

### Warning Signs:
- Marcus becoming wise or philosophical
- Perfect teamwork without conflict
- Technology that can't be explained practically
- Dialogue that sounds like exposition
- Details that exist only for atmosphere
- Voice becoming distant or formal
- Problems solved through coincidence or special powers

## The "Container Test"

**Core Question**: Does this scene feel like it could happen in Marcus's shipping container home?

If the tone, dialogue, or character behavior wouldn't fit in that cramped, practical space where Marcus shaves on the toilet and makes breakfast with care, then it's drifted from our Chapter 1 foundation.

The container is the heart of Marcus's world - modest, practical, lived-in, and full of small comforts that make a hard life bearable. Every scene should maintain that same grounded, human-scale intimacy.
