# Next Steps After Chorus Technology Revision

## Immediate Tasks

### 1. Consistency Review (Before Writing Chapter 7)
- Re-read Chapters 1-6 to internalize new direction
- Note any lingering consciousness references
- Create scene-by-scene outline incorporating Chorus elements

### 2. Expand Chorus Technology Details
- How does resonance sensitivity feel to Marcus?
- What do reality fractures look like?
- How do temporal anomalies manifest?
- What happens when sites cascade?

### 3. Character Voice Adjustments
- Ensure Rhea sounds like a partner, not an AI spokesperson
- Dr. Zhou needs archaeological expertise in dialogue
- Marcus should reference salvage instincts more
- Corporate villains need profit-focused language

## Chapter 7-10 Planning Priorities

### Plot Development
- Marcus learning to consciously use resonance sensitivity
- First attempt to interface with Chorus technology
- Corporate response to the investigation
- Discovery about the Graveyard's true nature

### World Building
- More details about pre-Crux Chorus civilization
- How modern tech depends on hidden Chorus infrastructure
- Other archaeological sites being targeted
- The preservation network's resources and limitations

### Character Development
- Marcus accepting his role as more than salvager
- Rhea's analysis of Chorus technology patterns
- Dr. Zhou's desperation about site destruction
- Corporate antagonist reveal and motivations

## Long-term Considerations

### Mystery Structure
- Plant clues about Graveyard being major Chorus node
- Build toward revelation of what Emerson discovered
- Escalate corporate response as stakes become clear
- Set up climactic choice: profit or preservation

### Thematic Development
- Knowledge belongs to everyone vs corporate control
- Individual actions affecting civilization's future
- Value of history and cultural heritage
- Technology as tool vs technology as power

### Avoiding Pitfalls
- Don't explain Chorus technology too thoroughly (maintain mystery)
- Keep Rhea's AI nature incidental to plot
- Avoid making it about "saving the galaxy" - keep stakes grounded
- Don't let archaeological elements become Indiana Jones pastiche

## Research/Reference Needs
- Real archaeological preservation conflicts
- Corporate monopolization tactics
- How discoveries change civilizations
- Cultural heritage law (for Detective Morganti's role)

## Style Reminders
- Marcus POV: practical, salvager's mindset
- Descriptions: focus on energy, resonance, distortion
- Chorus tech: impossible geometry, phase-shifting, temporal effects
- Tension: sites being destroyed is visceral loss

## Questions to Answer
1. What exactly did Dr. Emerson discover at Site Prime?
2. How does Marcus's sensitivity work in practice?
3. What makes the Graveyard special among Chorus sites?
4. Who is the corporate mastermind and why?
5. How can sites be preserved without destroying the economy?

## Climax Planning
- Location: The Graveyard itself (major Chorus node)
- Stakes: Activation could revolutionize or destroy
- Choice: Marcus must decide civilization's technological future
- Resolution: Balance between progress and preservation?
