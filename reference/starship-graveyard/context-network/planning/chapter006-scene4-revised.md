# Chapter 6 - Scene 4: Approaching the Site (Revised)

## Scene 4: Approaching Gamma-12

The site shouldn't have still been intact.

Marcus stared at the long-range sensors as their target resolved from navigational coordinates into actual structure. After all of Stellarion's claims about "catastrophic failures" at other sites, he'd expected ruins. Instead, he was seeing something magnificent.

"It's built into the asteroid," Dr. Vera Sandoval said, her voice filled with awe and anger. "Original Chorus architecture—they grew their installations rather than building them. And Stellarion's about to blow it up for quarterly earnings."

The structure was elegant and organic, as if the asteroid had grown buildings instead of having them carved into its surface. Marcus had salvaged enough ships to recognize good engineering when he saw it, but this defied everything he understood about construction.

Curved passages and chambers followed the natural fracture lines in the rock, integrated so perfectly it was hard to tell where nature ended and architecture began.

"Those energy signatures," Detective Morgan Oriz observed, studying the tactical display. "They're not reading like any power source I know."

Dr. Vera Sandoval pulled up comparison data. "That's genuine Chorus resonance. The site is still active after all these millennia. Self-sustaining, self-repairing. It's priceless."

Marcus felt the familiar shimmer even through the sensor readings. "And they're going to destroy this?"

"In approximately sixteen hours." She pulled up Stellarion's investor materials. "They've already pre-sold the 'discoveries' to three different sectors. Military contractors think they're getting teleportation technology. Medical investors have been promised regeneration chambers. The energy sector is expecting perpetual motion generators."

"All from the same site?" Detective Morgan Oriz asked.

"All from the same empty site. They'll show some props, blow the whole thing up claiming a 'resonance cascade,' then short their own stock on the way down." Dr. Chen's voice was bitter. "It's the same pattern they've used sixty times."

Rhea's voice came through the ship's speakers. "I'm detecting active security around the site. Stellarion has sensor nets, patrol drones, and what looks like a demolition team already in position."

"Already?" Marcus felt his stomach drop.

"They're ahead of schedule," Kit Salazar said from the scanning station. "Stock price must have peaked early. They're probably moving up the destruction timeline."

"How much time do we have?" Detective Morgan Oriz asked.

Dr. Vera Sandoval was studying the deployment patterns. "Maybe six hours before they start placing charges. Less if they detect us."

Marcus looked at the site on the sensor display—millions of years of history about to be erased for a stock bump. But this time, they had people who could prove it was real before the destruction.

"We need to get inside and document everything," he said. "How do we get past their security?"

Dr. Vera Sandoval highlighted an area on the display. "There's an access point on the dark side of the asteroid—an original Chorus entrance. Stellarion's retrofitted it, but the underlying structure should still respond to genuine resonance patterns."

"Should?"

"Your sensitivity to Chorus signatures, Marcus. The same thing that lets you spot fakes should let you activate real Chorus systems."

Detective Morgan Oriz was running tactical analysis. "I count six security platforms and a patrol ship. If they detect us, we'll be massively outgunned."

"Then we don't get detected." Marcus studied the approach vectors. "The asteroid's rotation brings that entrance into shadow every four hours. If we time it right, we can use the site itself as cover."

"And once we're inside?"

"We document everything. Collect samples. Find whatever evidence Kess Trizik left behind." Marcus looked at the team. "And we do it fast enough to get out before they blow the place."

"What about their pre-planted props?" Dr. Chen asked. "They'll claim any evidence we collect is fake."

Marcus smiled grimly. "That's why we need to document their props too. Show the serial numbers, the manufacturing marks. Prove they brought the fakes themselves."

"Corporate sabotage of their own fraud," Detective Morgan Oriz said appreciatively. "I like it."

Dr. Vera Sandoval was pulling up the site surveys. "Kess Trizik spent three weeks here before disappearing. If anyone could have documented the difference between real Chorus architecture and Stellarion's props, it would be Kess."

"Then we find that documentation," Marcus said. "And we make sure the universe sees it before Stellarion can claim another 'mysterious accident' destroyed priceless artifacts."

The ship adjusted course, angling toward the shadow side of the asteroid. In a few hours, they'd either expose the biggest archaeological fraud in history or become its latest victims.

"Marcus," Rhea said quietly, "I'm already transmitting our approach to those backup servers. If something happens—"

"Nothing's going to happen," Marcus said firmly. "We're going to get in, get the evidence, and get out. And then we're going to watch Stellarion's stock price crater when investors realize they've been funding the systematic destruction of genuine archaeological sites."

"Poetic justice," Kit Salazar said. "They profit from destruction, we'll destroy them with the truth."

As they approached Gamma-12, Marcus felt the shimmer growing stronger through the sensors. This was real Chorus architecture, not the props and lies Stellarion had been selling. And in a few hours, he'd be able to prove it.

Dr. Reeves had believed someone at a salvage yard would know the difference between real discoveries and corporate lies. He'd been right.

Now it was time to finish what his old mentor had started.
