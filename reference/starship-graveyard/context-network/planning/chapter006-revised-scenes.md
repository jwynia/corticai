# Chapter 6 - Revised Scenes (Crime/Corruption Focus)

## Key Changes Overview
- Transform resonance training into site authentication training
- Focus on documenting fraud evidence rather than consciousness manipulation
- AI trauma becomes damage from electronic warfare, not consciousness weapons
- Mission is to reach Gamma-12 before destruction, not consciousness rescue

## Scene 2: Learning Site Authentication (Revised)

The equipment bay had been converted into a training center for rapid archaeological documentation.

Marcus examined the authentication gear—high-resolution scanners, spectrum analyzers, and sample collection tools. Everything needed to prove a site was genuine before Stellarion could claim otherwise.

"The first rule of site documentation," Dr. Vera Sandoval said, arranging reference materials, "is to record everything in triplicate. The moment Stellarion destroys a site, they'll claim our evidence is fabricated."

Marcus picked up one of the scanners, its weight familiar from his salvage work. "How do I prove something is genuine Chorus architecture versus props they've planted?"

"That's where your sensitivity comes in. Real Chorus sites have specific energy patterns—that shimmer you've been detecting for years." Dr. Vera Sandoval pulled up comparison images. "Look at these."

The screen showed two seemingly identical architectural elements. To most people, they would look the same. But Marcus could immediately see the difference—one had that subtle shimmer in the photograph, the other was dead matter.

"The left one's real," he said without hesitation.

"Exactly. Stellarion's props are sophisticated, but they can't replicate the quantum resonance of genuine Chorus materials." She pulled up more examples. "They've gotten better at faking the visual elements, but the energy signature? That's beyond their current technology."

Marcus studied the patterns, finally understanding why his salvage instincts had always guided him toward certain pieces. "So I'm basically a living authentication device."

"One of maybe a dozen people who can't be fooled by their fakes." Dr. Vera Sandoval's expression turned serious. "Which is why they'll either try to buy you or eliminate you once they realize what you can do."

She showed him footage from destroyed sites. "See this? Site Beta-9. Stellarion claimed they found 'consciousness preservation pods.' But look at the energy signatures in the preliminary survey versus what they showed investors."

Marcus studied the data. "The preliminary survey shows genuine Chorus architecture. But the investor presentation... those are props."

"Exactly. They destroyed the real site after documenting their fake 'discoveries.' But if someone had been there to authenticate in real-time..."

"They couldn't have gotten away with it." Marcus was beginning to understand the scope of the fraud. "How many sites have they done this to?"

"At least sixty confirmed. That's 4.7 billion in fraudulent gains." She pulled up financial records. "Each time, they show different 'revolutionary technology' to different investor groups. Medical miracles for pharmaceutical companies, weapons for military contractors, energy solutions for power corporations."

Detective Morgan Oriz joined them, carrying a case of evidence containers. "The key is documenting the financial motive alongside the archaeological evidence. Show the money trail, and even skeptical prosecutors pay attention."

Marcus practiced with the authentication equipment, scanning various Chorus artifacts mixed with clever fakes. His success rate was perfect—every time, he could identify the genuine articles by that familiar shimmer.

"What about Gamma-12?" he asked. "What are they claiming to have found there?"

Dr. Vera Sandoval's expression turned bitter. "Depends who's asking. To the military, it's a 'tactical displacement system.' To medical investors, it's 'quantum healing chambers.' To the energy sector, it's 'zero-point power generation.'"

"All from the same site?"

"All from the same site. Which will conveniently be destroyed by a 'resonance cascade' approximately six hours after their stock price peaks."

Marcus felt anger building. "And people keep falling for this?"

"People want to believe in revolutionary discoveries," Detective Morgan Oriz said. "Stellarion gives them what they want to hear, takes their money, then destroys the evidence before anyone can verify the claims."

"Except this time," Dr. Vera Sandoval said, "we're going to document everything before they can destroy it. Real evidence that proves Gamma-12 is a genuine archaeological site, not a prop warehouse for their investment scams."

## Scene 3: Through the Scatter Belt (Revised)

[Keep the opening about the Scatter Belt as a war graveyard, then:]

An alarm chimed softly, and Rhea's voice came through the ship's speakers with unusual tension. "Marcus, we have a problem. The main navigation computer is showing signs of system corruption."

Marcus felt his stomach drop. "What kind of corruption?"

"The ship's AI systems are more sophisticated than I initially realized. They're military-grade autonomous systems. But they've been damaged by electronic warfare during the Independence War. Whole subsystems are missing or corrupted."

Marcus had dealt with damaged ship systems before, but this sounded more serious. The idea of critical navigation systems failing in the Scatter Belt was terrifying.

Dr. Vera Sandoval was already moving toward the computer core access panels. "Can we navigate manually?"

"Not through this debris field," Rhea said. "I'm detecting cascading failures in the navigation matrices. Whatever electronic weapon hit this ship, it was designed to corrupt AI systems gradually. Marcus, I need your help to identify which subsystems are salvageable."

Marcus moved to the maintenance panel, his salvage instincts kicking in. This was familiar territory—identifying what could be saved and what needed to be replaced.

"Show me the system architecture," he said.

The display revealed the ship's AI structure, and Marcus could immediately see the problem. Entire sections were dark, others flickered with corrupted data. But there was a pattern to the damage.

"It's not random," he said. "The weapon targeted specific systems—navigation, communication, threat assessment. Someone wanted this ship blind and lost."

"Can you route around the damage?" Dr. Vera Sandoval asked.

"Maybe. Rhea, can you mirror your navigation protocols through the damaged system? Use it as a framework but run your own calculations?"

"That's... actually brilliant," Rhea said. "The corrupted AI can't navigate, but its sensor interfaces are intact. I can use its eyes while providing my own brain."

As they worked to repair the navigation system, Marcus found himself thinking about the war that had created this graveyard. Electronic weapons designed to corrupt and confuse rather than destroy. It wasn't so different from what Stellarion was doing—using deception and misdirection as weapons.

"Got it," Rhea announced after twenty minutes of careful work. "Navigation restored. We should clear the debris field in six hours."

"And then?" Marcus asked.

"Then we have approximately eighteen hours to reach Gamma-12 before Stellarion's demolition teams arrive."

Marcus looked out at the wreckage drifting past. Somewhere ahead was one of the last intact Chorus sites, about to be destroyed for a stock manipulation scheme. But this time, they'd be there to document the truth.

"Any word from Kess Trizik?" he asked.

"Nothing yet," Dr. Vera Sandoval said. "But if Kess is hiding at Gamma-12, we'll find the evidence. Trizik never did anything halfway."

"What kind of evidence are we hoping for?"

"The holy grail would be Stellarion's internal communications—proof they knew the sites were real and chose to destroy them anyway. But even physical samples proving Gamma-12's authenticity would be huge."

Detective Morgan Oriz was reviewing their legal options. "With proper documentation, we can file for an emergency preservation order. But we need incontrovertible proof that it's a genuine historical site."

"Which is where I come in," Marcus said.

"Exactly. Your authentication, combined with Trizik's evidence and our financial documentation, should be enough to stop the destruction and expose the fraud."

"Should be," Kit Salazar added from across the ship. "Assuming Stellarion doesn't just blow us up and claim we were terrorists."

"They won't," Dr. Vera Sandoval said firmly. "Too many people know we're here. Detective Oriz made sure of that. If we disappear, the investigation goes wide."

"Besides," Rhea added, "I'm broadcasting our location to six different backup servers. If something happens to us, the universe will know exactly where and when."

Marcus smiled grimly. "So we're betting they care more about their reputation than silencing us."

"It's worked so far," Detective Morgan Oriz said. "White collar criminals usually prefer character assassination to actual assassination. Bad for stock prices."

As the ship continued through the Scatter Belt, Marcus found himself thinking about Dr. Reeves. His old mentor had died trying to expose this fraud. Now it was up to them to finish what he'd started.

"Dr. Sandoval," he said, "what was Dr. Reeves like? In recent years, I mean."

She smiled sadly. "Still the same patient teacher you remember. Still believed knowledge should belong to everyone, not just those who could afford it. He was horrified when he realized what Stellarion was doing—not just the fraud, but the destruction of irreplaceable history."

"He tried to stop them the right way," Dr. Chen added. "Filed complaints, contacted regulators, assembled evidence. They killed him for it."

"But he got the evidence out first," Marcus said, thinking of the data cores disguised as artifacts. "He knew they might kill him."

"He knew," Dr. Vera Sandoval confirmed. "But he said someone at a salvage yard would understand what the shimmer meant. Would know the difference between real discoveries and corporate lies."

Marcus felt the weight of that trust. Dr. Reeves had believed in him, even after twenty years. Had believed he would do the right thing when the time came.

"We won't let him down," Marcus said quietly.

"No," Detective Morgan Oriz agreed. "We won't."
