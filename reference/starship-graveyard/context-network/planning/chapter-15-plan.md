# Chapter 15 Plan: Corporate Escalation

## Current Story Position
- Teams are documenting evidence at multiple archaeological sites
- Stellarion is moving to destroy sites to cover up crimes
- Jake's team trapped at northern site
- Halcyon Industries emerges as potential ally/rival with different approach

## Chapter 15: "Corporate Escalation"

### Key Elements (adapted from outline):
1. **Stellarion's Violent Response**
   - Instead of random port explosion, Stellarion attacks one of the secondary nodes
   - They're willing to destroy their own objectives to stop the interference
   - This shows their desperation and ruthlessness

2. **Marcus in Action**
   - Marcus must coordinate rescue of Jake's team trapped by Stellarion
   - Shows his growth from solo salvager to team leader
   - Makes difficult decision to accept Halcyon's help

3. **Corporate Rivalry Revealed**
   - Halcyon Industries offers help through Meridian
   - They want archaeological sites intact for profit
   - Different approach than Stellarion's destruction

4. **Escalating Stakes**
   - Stellarion bringing demolition equipment to melt entire site
   - Other teams potentially compromised
   - Evidence being destroyed faster than it can be documented

5. **Character Development**
   - Marcus wrestling with responsibility for his team
   - Jake's family situation adds personal stakes
   - Trust issues with corporate "help"

### Scene Structure:
1. **Attack on Northern Node** - Jake's team under fire
2. **Rescue Operation** - Marcus coordinates response
3. **Halcyon Involvement** - New player enters the game
4. **Accelerating Timeline** - Stakes increase dramatically

### Themes:
- Archaeological preservation vs corporate destruction
- Working-class solidarity under pressure
- The price of accepting help from rivals
- Personal responsibility for team safety

### Setup for Chapter 16:
- Alliance forces getting closer but may be too late
- Need to pivot strategy with Halcyon's involvement
- Some team members injured/separated
- Stellarion preparing final push at Site 12
