## Implementation Checklist

### Global Find & Replace
- [ ] Sarah Chen → Rhea
- [ ] Zhang Wei → Vincent Webb
- [ ] Dr. Zhou / Dr. Vasquez → Dr. Vera Sandoval
- [ ] Maya Patel → Kit Salazar
- [ ] Detective Morganti → Detective Morgan Oriz
- [ ] Tobias Holden → Tobias Rinn
- [ ] Dr. Emerson → Dr. Emil Reeves

### Special Considerations
- Rhea has no surname (AIs typically don't)
- Kit is already a nickname (Katherine avoided as too formal)
- Morgan Oriz is gender-neutral (keep pronouns consistent)
- Webb and Salazar are common evolved surnames

### Dialogue Updates Needed
- Remove any references to Earth-specific cultures
- Add use-name explanations where natural
- Update any name-based wordplay
- Check for nickname consistency

## Worldbuilding Notes

### Naming Conventions Established
- AIs: Astronomical names (moons, stars, etc.)
- Professionals: Use-names for simplicity
- Surnames: Evolved blends, station names, occupations
- Given names: Simplified, multicultural evolution

### Example Name Evolution Dialogue
```
"The registration says Marcus Ramesh Patel-Chen-O'Brien, but that's three generations of marriage contracts. Everyone just calls me Marcus."
```

## Future Character Naming Guidelines
- Avoid obvious Earth culture names
- Use evolved/blended surnames
- Consider professional use-names
- Astronomical names for AIs/scientists
