## Purpose
Sample scene demonstrating the revelation moment when Marcus realizes they've been played.

## Scene: Kellerman's Interrogation (Chapter 25, Scene 4)

Marcus watched Thomas Kellerman through the detention center's reinforced glass. The VP of Archaeological Development looked smaller in the orange jumpsuit, shoulders slumped, hands cuffed to the table. Not the posture of a criminal mastermind who'd orchestrated twelve deaths and destroyed priceless archaeological sites.

"Five minutes," the guard said. "That's all the commissioner authorized."

Detective Vega nodded, her badge getting them through the security checkpoint. The interrogation room smelled of industrial disinfectant and fear sweat. Kellerman looked up as they entered, and Marcus saw something in his eyes that made his stomach clench.

Not guilt. Confusion.

"Mr. Patel," Kellerman said, voice hoarse. "The man who destroyed my life. Hope you're satisfied."

"You destroyed twelve lives," Vega said, settling into the chair across from him. "Including Emil Emerson. We have your authorization codes on every destruction order."

Kellerman laughed—a bitter sound that echoed off concrete walls. "My authorization codes. Do you know how many people use my codes? It's standard practice. Plausible deniability built into the system."

"Convenient excuse," Marcus said.

"Excuse?" Kellerman leaned forward, chains rattling. "I'm an accountant with a fancy title. I process paperwork after decisions are made three levels above me. You think I have the authority to destroy billion-credit sites?"

"The evidence—"

"The evidence is whatever they want it to be." Kellerman's voice dropped. "Twenty years I've been loyal. Never asked questions, never looked too close at the numbers. Perfect middle management. And now I'm the perfect fall guy."

Vega pulled out her tablet, scrolling through financial records. "These transfers to your personal accounts—"

"Appeared yesterday. Check the metadata. Real forensic accounting, not the summary they gave you." Kellerman met her eyes. "I'm being framed, Detective. And you helped them do it."

Marcus felt the certainty of the past day crumbling. "If you didn't authorize the site destructions—"

"Oh, I signed off on them. After they were already rubble. That's my job—make the paperwork match reality." Kellerman slumped back. "But I never ordered them. Never knew they were coming. Just got calls saying another site had an 'accident' and needed documentation."

"Then who?" Vega demanded.

"You're asking the wrong question." Kellerman stared at the wall, voice distant. "Not who. Why. Why destroy sites worth billions in legitimate research for millions in insurance fraud?"

"Because the research is fake," Marcus said automatically.

"No, Mr. Patel." Kellerman turned to face him fully. "Because the research is real. And what they found at those sites would change everything."

The room seemed to contract around them. Marcus heard his own heartbeat, too loud in the silence.

"What did they find?" Vega asked.

"I don't know specifics. Above my pay grade. But I heard whispers. Saw budget lines that didn't make sense. Black projects inside black projects. Government liaisons who weren't in any directory." Kellerman's laugh had an edge of hysteria. "You exposed a crime, sure. But not the crime you think."

"You're saying—"

"I'm saying you found the edge of something that makes insurance fraud look like a parking violation. And they're going to bury all of us to keep it quiet." He looked at Marcus. "They let you find me. Wanted you to. I'm the cover story that ends the investigation."

Marcus's phone buzzed. Rhea's emergency signal.

"Marcus," her voice came through his earpiece, "news just broke. Kellerman found dead in his cell. Apparent suicide. Coroner's van already en route."

Marcus looked at Kellerman, very much alive across the table. "How long do we have?"

"Minutes, probably." Kellerman smiled without humor. "They're efficient. I'll be dead, you'll be fugitives who drove me to it, and the real secret stays buried. Literally, in the case of those sites."

"We need to go," Vega said, already standing.

"Wait." Kellerman grabbed Marcus's wrist with cuffed hands. "Site 7. Before they destroyed it. The survey team found something. Not technology. Not artifacts. Evidence."

"Evidence of what?"

"That we're not the first. Not the second. Maybe not even the tenth." His grip tightened. "Every advanced civilization in this sector died the same way. And something wants to keep that pattern going."

The door burst open. Guards in tactical gear, not the standard detention center uniforms.

"Run," Kellerman said. "Now."

Marcus and Vega moved, training taking over. Out the door, down the corridor, alarms beginning to wail. Behind them, shouts and the distinctive whine of neural stunners.

They made it to the parking structure as Marcus's phone exploded with alerts. Their faces on every news feed. "Dangerous conspiracy theorists who drove innocent executive to suicide." "Armed and unstable." "Shoot on sight authorized."

"They played us," Vega said, starting the vehicle. "The whole investigation. They let us find what they wanted us to find."

"Yeah." Marcus watched the city blur past, safe house protocols already running through his mind. "But Kellerman gave us something they didn't expect."

"A fairy tale about ancient civilizations?"

"No." Marcus thought about the certainty in Kellerman's eyes, the specific terror of someone who'd glimpsed a truth too large to process. "A pattern. And if he's right, those destroyed sites weren't hiding fraud or even revolutionary technology."

"Then what?"

"Evidence that something has been killing spacefaring civilizations for millions of years. And now it knows we know."

The detention center exploded behind them. Not a small fire or discrete assassination. A pillar of flame that would leave nothing but slag and questions.

"So much for subtle," Vega muttered, taking a hard turn toward the industrial district.

Marcus pulled out his phone, already composing emergency signals to the others. The false victory had lasted exactly eighteen hours. Now the real war began.

And somewhere in the carefully destroyed archaeological sites, evidence waited that would explain why every civilization that reached for the stars eventually fell silent.

They just had to live long enough to find it.
