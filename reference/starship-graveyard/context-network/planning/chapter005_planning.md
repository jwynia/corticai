## Key Dialogue Examples

### Dr. Vasquez Introduction
**Vasquez:** "You found Thomas in your ship? Then they know you have the site data now. I'm sorry."
**Marcus:** "Sorry for what?"
**Vasquez:** "Your old life just ended. The question is whether you can save any sites before they destroy them all."

### Understanding the Stakes
**Survivor:** "They destroyed entire cities. Melted them down for rare elements after stripping the artifacts. Millennia of history gone in hours."
**Marcus:** "And Emerson tried to stop this?"
**Morganti:** "He was documenting everything. Question is: did he get the evidence out?"

### New Mission Statement
**Marcus:** "We're not just investigating a murder anymore."
**Morganti:** "What are we doing?"
**Marcus:** "We're trying to save history itself. Those sites Emerson found - they're about to be destroyed."
