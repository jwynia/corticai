**Marcus:** "I don't want statistics, Rhea. I want my life back."
**Rhea:** "That option became unavailable the moment we opened that cargo hold."

### First Morganti Meeting
**Morganti:** "You're either the unluckiest salvager in the sector or you know exactly what you pulled out of deep black."
**Marcus:** "I'm starting to think luck doesn't cover it."

### Point of No Return
**Stellarion Security:** "Mr. Patel, you're interfering with corporate asset recovery."
**Marcus:** "Last I checked, salvage laws were pretty clear. Unless you're saying this isn't really salvage?"

- Police precinct - sterile hostility contrasting with yard's warmth
