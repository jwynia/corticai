# Revision: Plot Documentation Alignment with Genre Consistency
Date: 2025-07-19

## Change Type
- [ ] Conceptual  - [X] Structural  - [ ] Prose

## Rationale
The plot overview and related documents still contain references to consciousness/AI hybrid themes that were successfully removed from the manuscript during the July 2025 genre consistency revision. This creates a dangerous mismatch where planning documents could reintroduce elements that were intentionally removed. Documentation must reflect the archaeological crime thriller that the manuscript has become.

## Predicted Consequences
- Immediate (1-2 chapters): Documentation will accurately guide any future work
- Medium-term (3-5 chapters): Consistent genre maintenance easier
- Story-wide: Reduced risk of reintroducing consciousness themes

## Monitoring Criteria
- Warning sign 1: Any new consciousness/mystical references appearing
- Warning sign 2: Plot descriptions contradicting manuscript reality
- Success indicator 1: All plot docs reflect archaeological thriller
- Success indicator 2: Mystery structure clearly documented

## Implementation Status
- [X] Initial change complete
- [X] Immediate cascade tasks identified
- [ ] Medium-term implications mapped
- [ ] Cascade tasks completed
- [ ] Validation complete
