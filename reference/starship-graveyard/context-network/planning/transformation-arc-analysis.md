**Price Paid:**

- Abandons profit motive entirely
- Embraces larger responsibility

**Key Realization:**
> "He was done running. Done reacting. Done letting corporations dictate his life."

## Transformation Mechanics

### External Pressures
1. **Corporate Threat**: FAC and Stellarion won't stop
2. **Time Pressure**: Sites being destroyed
3. **Team Responsibility**: Others depending on him
4. **No Escape**: Resources to run exhausted

### Internal Shifts
1. **From Reactive to Proactive**
   - Stops running, starts fighting
   - Makes plans instead of just responding

2. **From Individual to Leader**
   - Accepts responsibility for team
   - Delegates and trusts others

3. **From Profit to Purpose**
   - Values preservation over payment
   - Sees bigger picture than personal gain

4. **From Cynical to Committed**
   - Believes change is possible
   - Willing to sacrifice for others

## Genre-Appropriate Transformation

### Working-Class Elements Maintained

## How Transformation Serves the Mystery

### Investigation Skills

### Evidence Gathering

- Middle: Actively seeks evidence
- Late: Strategically documents crimes
- Final: Orchestrates exposure

### Relationship to Truth
- Start: Truth is dangerous, avoid it
- Middle: Truth might help survival
- End: Truth worth fighting for

## Supporting Cast Transformation Catalyst
