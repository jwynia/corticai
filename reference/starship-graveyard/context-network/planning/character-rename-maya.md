# Character Rename: Maya → ?

## Purpose
Document the renaming of Maya Patel to avoid sci-fi cliche naming conventions, supporting the story's genre-aware approach.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Dynamic
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## The Problem
"Maya Patel" reads as stereotypical sci-fi character naming:
- "Maya" = mystical/exotic coding
- Combined with Indian surname = standard "diverse future" trope
- Too on-the-nose for a story where characters recognize tropes

## Character Role Reminder
- Archaeological crimes specialist
- Financial investigator tracking site destruction
- Practical, skeptical, data-driven
- Not mystical or exotic - just good at her job

## Name Considerations

### What we want to convey:
- Professional competence
- Investigative background
- Could be from anywhere (future is multicultural without being performative)
- Memorable but not "trying too hard"

### What to avoid:
- Overly exotic first names
- "Future-sounding" made-up names
- Heavy-handed cultural signaling
- Sci-fi standards (Maya, Zara, Nova, Luna, etc.)

## Name Suggestions

### Option 1: **Helen Okafor**
- Helen = classic, professional, timeless
- Suggests someone serious and competent
- Okafor = Nigerian surname, natural multiculturalism

### Option 2: **Rebecca Chen**
- Rebecca/Becca = approachable but professional
- Common enough to feel real
- Chen = extremely common surname globally

### Option 3: **Diana Molina**
- Diana = strong, classic, investigative associations
- Not trying too hard to be "futuristic"
- Molina = common Hispanic surname

### Option 4: **Sarah Desai**
- Sarah = most common name, deliberately ordinary
- Ironic given our AI is named Sarah (could be plot point)
- Shows future where Indian names are unremarkable

### Option 5: **Katherine "Kit" Nakamura**
- Katherine = formal/professional
- "Kit" = nickname gives personality
- Practical nickname for field investigator

### Option 6: **Jessica Singh**
- Jessica = generically professional
- Deliberately boring first name
- Contrast with her interesting job

## Recommendation: **Kit Nakamura**

### Why this works:
- "Kit" sounds like someone who solves problems
- Nickname suggests colleagues know her well
- Professional but not stuffy
- Memorable without being "exotic"
- Could have dialogue about sci-fi naming:
  - "My parents wanted to name me Zephyr Luna. Thank god my grandmother intervened."

### Character voice with new name:
"Kit Nakamura, Archaeological Crimes Division. And before you ask, no, I don't have any mystical connection to ancient artifacts. I have a degree in forensic accounting and a very good spreadsheet."

## Implementation Notes

### Find and Replace:
- Maya Patel → Kit Nakamura throughout
- Adjust any dialogue that played on the "Maya" name
- Update character profiles

### Personality implications:
- "Kit" suggests someone practical, prepared
- Carries tools/equipment (kit)
- Ready for fieldwork
- No-nonsense approach

### Potential dialogue addition:
```
Marcus: "Kit? That short for something?"
Kit: "Katherine. But the only person who calls me that is my mother when she's disappointed in my life choices."
"Such as?"
"Such as spending my career crawling through ruins instead of making partner at a law firm."
```
