# Galactic Naming Conventions Revision

## Purpose
Establish realistic naming conventions for a multi-system civilization where Earth cultures have blended and evolved over centuries of interstellar colonization.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Worldbuilding
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Conceptual
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## The Problem
Current names are too Earth-culture specific for a galactic civilization:
- Sarah Chen, Zhang Wei = concentrated Chinese names
- Direct Earth cultural naming unlikely after centuries of mixing
- Falls into "Earth cultures in space" trope
- Unrealistic for multi-generation spacefaring civilization

## Realistic Galactic Naming Evolution

### What would really happen:
1. **Cultural blending** - Names from different traditions merge
2. **Linguistic drift** - Pronunciations and spellings evolve
3. **New naming traditions** - Based on ships, stations, events
4. **Simplified surnames** - For multi-system documentation
5. **Professional use-names** - Chosen for work contexts

### Naming patterns that make sense:
- Ship/station names become surnames
- Given names simplified for cross-cultural use
- Nicknames and use-names very common
- Some traditional names preserved but altered
- New names from colony experiences

## Character Renames

### Sarah Chen (AI) → **Rhea**
- Ship AIs often named after astronomical bodies
- Rhea = Saturn's moon, simple, memorable
- No surname needed for AI
- Fits maritime naming traditions in space

### Zhang Wei → **Marcus Webb**
- Webb = evolved from various "Wei/Way/Webb" surnames
- Marcus = transcultural, works in many languages
- Sounds like successful corporate executive
- Not trying to be exotic

### Dr. Elizabeth Zhou → **Dr. Elara Sandoval**
- Elara = Jupiter moon (scientists often take astronomical names)
- Sandoval = evolved Spanish/Portuguese, common in colonies
- Professional but not Earth-specific

### Kit Nakamura → **Kit Salazar**
- Keep Kit (good working name)
- Salazar = common evolved surname across systems
- Rolls off tongue, memorable

### Detective Morganti → **Detective Morgan Oriz**
- Morgan = gender-neutral, professional
- Oriz = shortened/evolved from various origins
- Sounds like a real cop name

### Tobias Holden → **Tobias Rinn**
- Keep Tobias (classic, works)
- Rinn = short, efficient, could be from anywhere
- Government agents often have simplified names

## Additional Naming Worldbuilding

### Station-based surnames:
- Kessler = from Kessler Station
- Portos = from Port operations
- Vega = from Vega System

### Ship-lineage names:
- Drifter = from generation ship families
- Courier = from messenger ship tradition
- Salvager = occupational surname

### Blend examples:
- Amari = African/Arabic/Japanese blend
- Reyes-Park = Hispanic/Korean fusion
- Chen-Silva = Chinese/Portuguese combination

### Use-name culture:
"My registered name is Elizaveta Mariko Chen-Volkov, but everyone calls me Liz Vega after where I trained."

## Implementation Strategy

### Character introductions could include:
```
"Marcus Webb. And before you ask, yes, it's a use-name. My birth certificate says something unpronounceable involving three different Earth languages and a station designation."
```

### Natural worldbuilding:
```
"The salvage yard registration lists about fifteen different spellings of my name. I just go by Marcus these days. Easier for everyone."
```

### Humor opportunities:
```
Kit: "At least your name fits on forms. Try having a traditional Mars-Japanese-Brazilian triple-barrel surname."
Marcus: "This is why everyone just uses nicknames."
```

## Benefits

### Worldbuilding depth:
- Shows centuries of cultural evolution
- Reflects realistic linguistic change
- Avoids Earth-centric thinking

### Character opportunities:
- Use-names reveal personality
- Name choices show background
- Creates natural conversation topics

### Reader accessibility:
- Names still pronounceable and memorable
- Not trying too hard to be "alien"
- Feels evolved rather than invented

## Final Character Names
1. **Marcus Patel** → Marcus Patel (keep, common enough to be universal)
2. **Sarah Chen** → Rhea (AI)
3. **Zhang Wei** → Marcus Webb
4. **Dr. Elizabeth Zhou** → Dr. Elara Sandoval  
5. **Maya/Kit Nakamura** → Kit Salazar
6. **Detective Morganti** → Detective Morgan Oriz
7. **Tobias Holden** → Tobias Rinn

## Wait...

We have two Marcuses now. Let's fix:
**Zhang Wei** → **Vincent Webb** (corporate exec name)
