# Theme Checklist for Scene Writing

## Purpose
Quick reference checklist to ensure every scene maintains thematic consistency with Starship Graveyard's archaeological thriller genre and working-class perspective.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Writing Process
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Abstraction:** Practical
- **Confidence:** Established

## Pre-Scene Check

### Genre Alignment
- [ ] No consciousness or mystical elements
- [ ] Technology has technical (not magical) explanations
- [ ] Stakes are human-scale and relatable
- [ ] Conflict driven by greed/power, not cosmic forces

### Working-Class Perspective
- [ ] Economic concerns present or implied
- [ ] Practical problem-solving approach
- [ ] Skills earned through experience shown
- [ ] No "chosen one" or destiny elements

## During Scene Check

### Character Voice
- [ ] Marcus maintains skepticism about mystical explanations
- [ ] Technical jargon is accurate but accessible
- [ ] Dialogue is direct, not philosophical
- [ ] Humor used as coping mechanism (when appropriate)

### Thematic Reinforcement
Does the scene advance at least one core theme?
- [ ] Preservation vs Exploitation
- [ ] Working-class agency
- [ ] Truth through evidence
- [ ] Found family/solidarity

### World-Building Consistency
- [ ] Archaeological sites described as technological archives
- [ ] Corporate villains motivated by profit/power
- [ ] Government corruption shown through bureaucracy
- [ ] Crux as living culture, not mystical beings

## Scene-Specific Elements

### Investigation Scenes
- [ ] Evidence-based discovery (not intuition)
- [ ] Technical skills used to uncover truth
- [ ] Documentation emphasized
- [ ] Corporate obstruction realistic

### Action Scenes
- [ ] Danger from human/corporate threats
- [ ] Solutions use available tools/skills
- [ ] Team coordination emphasized
- [ ] Stakes remain personal/tangible

### Character Development Scenes
- [ ] Growth through choice and action
- [ ] Relationships built on trust/shared experience
- [ ] Financial pressures influence decisions
- [ ] Community bonds strengthen

### Revelation Scenes
- [ ] Information discovered through investigation
- [ ] Evidence supports conclusions
- [ ] Corporate crimes exposed factually
- [ ] No mystical revelations or visions

## Post-Scene Validation

### Quick Tests
1. **The Marcus Test**: Would Marcus believe this or call bullshit?
2. **The Worker Test**: Does this respect working-class intelligence?
3. **The Genre Test**: Could this scene work in a techno-thriller?
4. **The Stakes Test**: Are consequences concrete and measurable?

### Red Flags to Fix
- Characters accepting mystical explanations without skepticism
- Technology working "because it does" without explanation
- Stakes becoming abstract or philosophical
- Sudden special abilities or destiny reveals
- Corporate villains with unclear profit motives

## Common Pitfall Fixes

### If Mystical Elements Creep In
- Replace with technical malfunction
- Add Marcus's skeptical interpretation
- Ground in electromagnetic/energy effects
- Show practical cause and effect

### If Stakes Get Too Abstract
- Add financial consequence
- Show impact on specific people
- Connect to job/home/safety
- Make it affect the crew directly

### If Dialogue Gets Philosophical
- Cut to practical concern
- Add interruption with immediate problem
- Have Marcus redirect to concrete issue
- Insert humor to deflate pretension
