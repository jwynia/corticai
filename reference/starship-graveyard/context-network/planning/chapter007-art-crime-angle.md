# Chapter 7 - Art Crime/Money Laundering Angle

## The Real Scheme: More Sophisticated Than Simple Fraud

### How Art Crime Makes It Work:

1. **Flexible Valuation**
   - Chorus artifacts have no established market value
   - Stellarion creates the market, sets the prices
   - "Authentication" comes from their own experts
   - Destroyed sites mean no one can verify

2. **The Laundering Mechanism**
   - Sell "authenticated" artifacts to collectors/museums
   - Use inflated values to move money between subsidiaries
   - Insurance claims on "lost" pieces when sites destroyed
   - Create artificial scarcity by destroying sources

3. **Multiple Revenue Streams**
   - Direct sales of "authenticated" artifacts
   - Insurance fraud (sites destroyed by "accidents")
   - Stock manipulation (announcements of discoveries)
   - Money laundering fees (cleaning money for others)
   - Tax benefits (donating overvalued pieces)

## What They'd Find in Chapter 7:

### Instead of Movie Props:
- Sophisticated forgeries with fake provenance papers
- Real artifacts mixed with fakes to confuse authentication
- Documentation showing which pieces went to which collectors
- Price manipulation records showing 1000% markups
- Lists of complicit authentication experts

### Instead of Joke Videos:
- Cold discussions of "market creation"
- Calculations of how site destruction increases artifact values
- Client lists including criminal organizations
- Discussion of which experts to buy or eliminate
- Dr. Reeves marked as threat to "authentication credibility"

### The Warehouse Contains:
- Mixing facility where real/fake artifacts are combined
- Aging chambers to make new pieces look ancient
- Fragments of real Chorus material used to "salt" fakes
- Documentation systems creating false provenance
- Client communication about "acquisition preferences"

### Financial Records Show:
- Money flows from criminal organizations
- Artifact sales at massively inflated prices
- Insurance claims on destroyed collections
- Tax havens receiving laundered funds
- Bribes to museum curators and experts

## Why This Works Better:

1. **Real-World Parallel**: This mirrors actual art crime/laundering schemes
2. **Explains Site Destruction**: Can't have real sites contradicting their "authenticated" pieces
3. **Multiple Victims**: Not just investors but museums, collectors, taxpayers
4. **Higher Stakes**: Connected to organized crime, not just corporate greed
5. **Smarter Villains**: This requires sophisticated planning, not cartoon evil

## Trizik's Evidence Would Include:
- Photos proving specific "authenticated" pieces are fake
- Records of which real artifacts were destroyed vs. sold
- Documentation of forgery techniques
- List of corrupted experts and their payments
- Proof that Stellarion knows which pieces are fake

## How Marcus's Sensitivity Matters:
- He can instantly tell real from fake artifacts
- His authentication would be legally valuable
- Stellarion would want him as validator OR dead
- He could expose entire collections as fraudulent
- Museums would need him to audit their collections

## The Crime's Elegance:
- Create a market (Chorus artifacts are valuable)
- Control supply (destroy sites, creating scarcity)
- Control authentication (buy the experts)
- Set prices (no one else knows values)
- Launder money (through inflated sales)
- Destroy evidence (blow up the sites)

## Dialogue Examples:

Executive 1: "The Krasnov collection needs three more authenticated pieces."
Executive 2: "Mix two genuine fragments with one complete forgery. Standard ratio."
Executive 1: "Price point?"
Executive 2: "Twelve million for the set. The buyers need to move twenty million this quarter."

Later:

Dr. Sandoval: "They're not just selling fakes. They're creating an entire shadow economy based on cultural destruction."
Marcus: "And using it to launder money for who knows who."
Kit: "The client list... these aren't just collectors. These are shell companies for criminal organizations."

## The Horror:
It's not that they're destroying history for quarterly earnings. They're destroying history to create a criminal financial infrastructure that turns cultural heritage into a money laundering service.

This makes Stellarion genuinely dangerous, not just greedy. They're connected to organized crime, they've corrupted the archaeological establishment, and they've turned humanity's heritage into a criminal enterprise.
