# Chapter 6 Comprehensive Updates Summary

## Replacements Made Successfully
- Medical bay → equipment bay (for resonance calibration)
- Consciousness interface training → resonance calibration 
- Consciousness bridging → Chorus resonance
- Neural sensors → resonance sensors
- Memory fragments → resonance patterns
- Consciousness transfer horror → temporal anomaly dangers

## Remaining Issues to Fix
1. Many instances of "Dr. Vasquez" need to be "Dr. Zhou" (20+ instances)
2. Many instances of "facility" should be "site" when referring to the Chorus installation
3. References to "Thomas" should be "Emil"
4. "Consciousness interface" and variants need updating
5. "Hybrid entity/entities" references need to become temporal anomalies or site phenomena

## Key Conceptual Changes Needed
- FROM: Rescuing Dr. Emerson's consciousness from a hybrid matrix
- TO: Recovering Dr. Emerson's data from a damaged Chorus site

- FROM: Horror of consciousness being used as living computers
- TO: Horror of ancient sites being stripped for profit

- FROM: 30+ trapped consciousnesses calling for help
- TO: 30+ reality fractures from extraction damage

- FROM: Facility using hybrid entities as infrastructure
- TO: Site being systematically harvested for Chorus technology

## Next Steps
Due to the extensive changes needed and multiple overlapping references, recommend:
1. Complete manual revision of Chapter 6 to ensure consistency
2. Focus on maintaining the dramatic tension while shifting from consciousness horror to archaeological destruction
3. Ensure Marcus's character arc remains intact (comfortable salvager → protector of ancient knowledge)
