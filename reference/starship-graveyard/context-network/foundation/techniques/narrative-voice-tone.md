## Overview
This guide defines the narrative voice and tone for the Starship Graveyard series, emphasizing a working-class sci-fi aesthetic with grounded, conversational prose.

## Core Voice Principles

### 1. Conversational Immediacy
The narrative voice speaks directly to the reader as if telling a story to a friend, using informal language and accessible metaphors.

**Example**: "Marcus Patel told people he owned a starship graveyard. Marcus was also a bit prone to stretching the truth for the sake of drama."

### 2. Technical Accessibility
Complex technology is explained through everyday comparisons and practical concerns rather than technical specifications.

**Example**: "Basically, a Packrat is a skip drive engine and a set of clamps to hold shipping containers and as little else they can get away with."

### 3. Working-Class Perspective
Technology and settings are described from the viewpoint of someone who works with their hands, emphasizing function over form.

**Example**: "Everything in the office was utilitarian, most out of some sort of default gray, extruded stic panels. The kind of thing that gets cranked out of a fab unit when building workspaces that no one above the magic line of rank and power would ever visit."

## Sentence Structure Patterns

### Short Declarative Anchors
Begin scenes and paragraphs with simple, direct statements that ground the reader.
- "The bathroom of one of the living module containers for the Packrat shipping system was pretty cramped."
- "Quinnett's office was just to the left."
- "The car lifted off the ground to cruising height and sped off."

### Compound Observations
Follow anchors with longer sentences that add layers of detail and context.
- "But, it made up for it in being really comfortable everywhere else."
- "There were only so many in rotation out there and there was no reason to waste a larger vehicle."

### Stream-of-Consciousness Tangents
Allow the narrative to follow natural thought patterns, especially when describing Marcus's ADHD perspective.
- "Which was an attitude that suited the folks at Pinnacle just fine, because they had a whole line of wonderful modules all built as shipping containers you could live in, fly from, ship stuff in, fly people around in, throw parties in, whatever."

## Technical Presentation Style

### The "Actually" Pattern
Introduce technical details through correction or clarification.
- "Technically, only Rhea was sentient..."
- "Technically, the Packrat was a starship. But..."
- "Officially, it was the Pinnacle Robust Transport. But..."

### Practical Context First
Always ground technical elements in their practical use before explaining details.
- NOT: "The Oort Serval featured split cargo hold technology."
- YES: "The twelve, with the split cargo hold, but it's locked down, so who knows if that's accurate."

### Anthropomorphic Tech
Give technology personality through how it's used rather than what it is.
- "the weird click when he moved"
- "an old, clunky magnetic lock opened"
- "the ship sat wrong"

## Metaphor and Imagery Guidelines

### Industrial Poetry
Find beauty in the mundane and mechanical.
- "a weirdly painterly and beautiful view of the port"
- "shadows and textures" of the salvage yard
- "like a red star solar flare scraping the entire atmosphere off a planet"

### Sensory Grounding
Root descriptions in physical sensations.
- "the vibration rattling through the walls and straight into his bones"
- "stained dark from decades of engine wash"
- "grease-stained coveralls"

### Everyday Comparisons
Use familiar, working-class reference points.
- "mess in the kitchen" not "culinary detritus"
- "shoved that mess into your gob" not "consumed your meal"
- "the kind of chair where it might even be OK that someone needed to talk"

## Emotional Beat Handling

### Understated Vulnerability
Express emotions through physical reactions and indirect observations.
- "an unfamiliar warmth spreading in his chest and a lump forming in his throat"
- "his heart rate picking up slightly"
- "His fingers tapped unconsciously on the arm of the chair"

### Deflection Through Humor
Use self-deprecating or situational humor to handle emotional moments.
- "ADHD could shove interest level off a cliff like that once the dopamine was gone"
- "it'll be some corporate exec's stash of contraband snacks"

### Community Connection
Show emotional depth through relationships and small kindnesses.
- Quinnett putting Marcus's name forward
- The shared joke about contraband cookies
- "People didn't go out of their way to make things easier for him"

## Dialogue Integration

### Natural Interruptions
Weave action and thought between dialogue naturally.
- Characters pause to take bites of food
- Physical gestures punctuate speech
- Environmental sounds interrupt conversations

### Casual Professional
Balance workplace competence with informal speech.
- "Hey Marcus" not "Good morning, Mr. Patel"
- Technical terms used casually within informal sentences
- Shorthand and assumed knowledge between regulars

## Pacing Techniques

### Scene Breathing
Alternate between action and reflection, allowing moments to land.
- Description of breakfast preparation (action)
- Reflection on ADHD and guilt (internal)
- Checking the salvage yard (transitional action)

### Information Layering
Reveal world details gradually through natural observation.
- First mention Packrat as just a ship
- Later explain what a Packrat actually is
- Finally reveal why Marcus uses one
