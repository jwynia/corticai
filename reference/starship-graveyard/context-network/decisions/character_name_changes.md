# Character Name Changes Decision Record

## Purpose
This document records character naming decisions made to avoid sci-fi clichés and improve naming diversity.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Decision
- **Stability:** Static
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established

## Decision Date
2025-01-28

## Context
During Chapter 2 drafting, it was identified that several character names fell into common sci-fi naming clichés:
- Overuse of astronomical names (Vega, Kepler, Elara)
- Use of "Chen" - an LLM naming pattern that appears frequently in AI-generated sci-fi
- Need for more naming diversity reflecting multicultural future

## Decision Criteria
Based on the Universal Setting Character Naming Framework:
- Avoid astronomical naming clichés
- Reflect multicultural future society
- Use 50th-95th percentile approach (distinctive but believable)
- Names should reflect character function/role
- Maintain phonetic consistency within character groups

## Decisions Made

### 1. Chen → Vasquez
- **Original:** Chen (dock worker)
- **New:** Vasquez
- **Rationale:** Avoids the overused "Chen" pattern in LLM-generated sci-fi while maintaining working-class authenticity
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED in Chapter 2

### 2. Detective Vega → Detective Morganti
- **Original:** Detective Vega
- **New:** Detective Morganti
- **Rationale:** 
  - Italian surname meaning "morning/dawn" - thematically appropriate for uncovering truth
  - Professional yet distinctive
  - Avoids astronomical cliché while keeping investigative gravitas

### 3. Lara Kepler → Lara Desai
- **Original:** Lara Kepler (pilot with corporate connections)
- **New:** Lara Desai
- **Rationale:**
  - Keeps approachable first name
  - Indian surname reflecting multicultural future
  - "Desai" historically means "provincial leader" - fitting for corporate connections
  - Avoids astronomer reference cliché

### 4. Elara Quinnett → No Change
- **Decision:** Keep as is
- **Rationale:**
  - While Elara is a moon name, paired with unusual "Quinnett" it works
  - Already established in Chapter 2
  - The combination is distinctive enough to avoid cliché
