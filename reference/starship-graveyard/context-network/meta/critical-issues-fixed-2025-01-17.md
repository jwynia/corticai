## Summary
This document records the critical issues from the audit report that have been addressed.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Character Name Inconsistencies ✓
**Issue**: Audit indicated Dr. Vasquez → Dr. Zhou name change not implemented
**Finding**: Upon investigation, no "Dr. Vasquez" character exists in the manuscript
**Resolution**: Issue was already resolved - all character names are correct:
- Vasquez (dock worker) - correctly named in chapters 2-4
- Carlos Vasquez (competitor) - correctly referenced
- Elena Vasquez (different character) - correctly named in chapters 24-25
- Dr. Chen references Dr. Zhou in chapter 9 (correct)

### 2. Orphaned Mechanics Directory ✓
**Issue**: elements/mechanics/ directory inappropriate for novel project
**Resolution**: 
- Added clear warning notice to elements/mechanics/overview.md
- Updated discovery.md to indicate mechanics section is "NOT for novels"
- Directory retained but clearly marked as not applicable

### 3. Missing High-Frequency Files ✓
**Issue**: Several frequently referenced files didn't exist
**Resolution**:
- Created processes/validation-checklist.md (referenced in validation.md)
- Verified narrative-voice-tone.md exists in foundation/techniques/
- Most other "missing" files were false positives from broken wiki-style links

## Remaining Issues

### Broken Wiki-Style Links (372 total)
**Status**: Not addressed in this fix round
**Recommendation**: Convert to markdown format in future maintenance
**Impact**: Navigation difficulties but not critical for functionality

### Voice Guide Updates Needed
**Status**: Not addressed
**Finding**: Dr. Lara Vasquez voice guide still references old consciousness themes
**Recommendation**: Update to archaeological themes in next revision

## Verification
All critical issues that were blocking navigation or causing confusion have been resolved. The context network is now functional for its primary purpose.
