# Context Network Cleanup Summary - 2025-01-17

## Overview
Completed cleanup of remaining issues identified in the context network audit.

## Tasks Completed

### High Priority ✓

1. **Character Name Consistency**
   - Verified all character names are already correct
   - No instances of "Dr. Vasquez" needing change to "Dr. Zhou"
   - False positive from outdated audit information

2. **Voice Guide Updates**
   - Updated Dr. Lara Vasquez voice guide from consciousness themes to archaeological themes
   - Replaced all references to Project Resonance, consciousness bridging, etc.
   - Now properly reflects archaeological preservation storyline

3. **Critical Navigation Links**
   - Converted wiki-style links to markdown in key planning documents
   - Main navigation files (index.md, discovery.md) already using markdown
   - Fixed links in current_status.md for chapter planning references

### Medium Priority ✓

4. **Oversized Files**
   - Added warning notices to non-applicable files:
     - `elements/plot/interactive_narrative_frameworks.md` - marked as games-only
     - `elements/mechanics/overview.md` - already had warning, no change needed
   - Decided not to split `naming_frameworks.md` (407 lines) as it's cohesive
   - Template files in archive don't need splitting

5. **Archive Deprecation Notices**
   - Created `DEPRECATION-NOTICE.md` in memory-bank directory
   - Added deprecation header to `characters.md` as example
   - Clearly mapped old locations to new ones

### Low Priority ✓

6. **Fantasy Novel Example**
   - Reviewed and decided to keep as educational reference
   - Already isolated and clearly marked as example
   - Not causing navigation issues

7. **Link Conversion Script**
   - Created `scripts/convert-links.sh` for future use
   - Basic implementation with common conversions
   - Handles backup creation and reporting

## Scripts Created

1. `scripts/fix-links.sh` - General link maintenance helper
2. `scripts/convert-links.sh` - Wiki to markdown link converter

Both scripts made executable and ready for use.

## Remaining Issues (Not Critical)

1. **372 broken wiki-style links** - These remain throughout the network but:
   - Critical navigation paths now use markdown
   - Discovery layer provides self-contained records
   - Not blocking core functionality

2. **Minor metadata inconsistencies** - Some files use template placeholders
   - Low impact on usability
   - Can be updated as files are modified

## Key Improvements

1. **Navigation Resilience** - Critical paths now more maintainable
2. **Theme Consistency** - All character guides reflect current archaeological theme
3. **Clear Boundaries** - Non-applicable content clearly marked
4. **Future Maintenance** - Scripts available for ongoing link management

## Next Steps

The context network is now in good health with all critical issues resolved. Future maintenance should focus on:
1. Gradual link conversion as files are updated
2. Metadata completion during regular edits
3. Using discovery layer for new insights
