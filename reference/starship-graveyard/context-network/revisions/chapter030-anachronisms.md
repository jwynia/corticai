# Chapter 030 Anachronism Review

## Technology

### Multiple "phone" references:
- **Line 21**: "His phone buzzed" - should be "comm"
- **Line 21**: "burners" - OK, established as slang for disposable comms
- **Line 75**: "Ancient alien phone trees" - humorous, but should be "comm trees"
- **Line 85**: "burner phone" - should be "burner comm" or just "burner"
- **Line 113**: "His phone buzzed" - should be "comm"

## Food & Beverage

### Line 27: "enough to buy coffee and the right to be hunted"
- **Good as is**: Shows coffee as basic/cheap commodity
- **Fits world**: Not Marcus's special real coffee

### Line 59: "Ancient alien coffee recipes?"
- **Good**: Humorous reference showing coffee persists

## Language

### Line 85: "tell them to go screw themselves"
- **Natural**: Modern profanity that would persist

## What Works Well

1. **"Burners"** as slang for disposable communications
2. Coffee references that fit the semantic drift principle
3. Natural dialogue and reactions
4. Corporate threat atmosphere

## Issues to Address

### Consistency Issue
- Multiple instances of "phone" that should be "comm"
- "Burner phone" should be "burner comm" or just "burner"

## Recommendations

1. Global replace "phone" â†’ "comm" in this chapter
2. Keep "burners" as natural slang
3. Coffee references are fine as is
