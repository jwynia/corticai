# Specific Technology Replacement Examples

## Communication Device Replacements

### Chapter 20
**Original**: "She pulled out a burner phone, its cheap plastic case"
**Revision**: "She pulled out a disposable comm, its cheap composite casing already starting to crack"
**Note**: Keeps the throwaway nature but updates the tech

### Chapter 24
**Original**: "making phone calls"
**Revision**: "making comm pings" or simply "making calls"
**Note**: "Call" is generic enough to stay

### Chapter 30
**Original**: "His phone buzzed"
**Revision**: "His comm chimed" or "His wrist unit pulsed"
**Note**: Different alert types for different comm styles

## Transportation Replacements

### Chapter 21

**Revision Options**:
1. "Marcus climbed into his hauler—forty years old but still running strong"
2. "Marcus settled into the worn control seat of his Koyama-class hauler"
3. "Marcus fired up the hauler, its old fusion core grumbling before the repulsors lifted"

### Chapter 30
**Original**: "A van pulled up"
**Revision Options**:
1. "A carrier settled onto its landing skids with a hydraulic hiss"
2. "A multi-passenger transport glided to a stop"
3. "An anonymous grey carrier approached, its windows privacy-tinted"

## Fashion Replacements

### Chapter 4 - Detective Oriz
**Original**: "leather jacket, shoulder holster"
**Revision**: "a detective's coat that had seen better decades, the holster worn smooth from daily carry"
**Character Note**: "Leather" becomes implied through wear/age

### Corporate Attire
**Original**: "expensive suit"
**Revision Options**:
1. "expensive suit—Core-tailored from the cut"
2. "the kind of suit that whispered money with every line"
3. "fresh suit, still showing import creases"

### Casual Wear
**Original**: "jeans and a t-shirt"
**Revision Options**:
1. "thermals" (simple, everyone knows what this means)
2. "work thermals, worn but clean"
3. "dock casuals" (implies tougher wear)

## Technology in Action

### Comm Usage Scene
**Original**: "She answered her phone on the third ring"
**Revision**: "She tapped her comm on the third chime, the holo-display flickering to life above her wrist"

### Vehicle Scene
**Original**: "The truck's engine coughed to life"
**Revision**: "The hauler's drive core cycled up with a stuttering whine—needed maintenance, but it would run"

### Fashion Description
**Original**: "He straightened his tie"
**Revision**: "He adjusted his collar tabs—the color-shifting strips that indicated his department and clearance level"

## Integration Tips

1. **Keep familiar actions** - people still "call" each other, "drive" vehicles
2. **Add tech details sparingly** - mention holo-displays or repulsors only when relevant
3. **Use character reactions** - Marcus prefers older/simpler tech
4. **Show class differences** - quality of tech indicates status
5. **Maintain readability** - don't over-explain the technology
