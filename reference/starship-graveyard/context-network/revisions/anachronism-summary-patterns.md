# Anachronism Summary - Patterns Found

## Most Common Issues

### 1. Phone vs Comm Inconsistency
**Pattern**: "Phone" appears throughout when "comm" would be more consistent
**Chapters affected**: 3, 5, 8, 20, 30 (and likely others)
**Solution**: Global search/replace "phone" → "comm"
**Exception**: Could keep "phone" with semantic drift understanding

### 2. Earth-Centric References
**Found**:
- Chapter 1: "late 20th century on Earth's smallest continent"
- Chapter 8: "hand-carved wooden panels from Earth forests (extinct)"
**Solution**: Remove Earth-specific geography/make forests generic

### 3. Corporate Names
**Found**: "Stellarion" in some chapters
**Solution**: Already replaced with "Brenner-Voigt" in many places, complete the replacement

### 4. Fashion/Materials
**Minor issues**:
- "Real leather" - might not need qualifier
- "Armani suit" - Earth brand names unlikely to survive
**Solution**: Remove brand names, let context show quality

## What Works Well (Don't Change)

### 1. Food/Beverage with Semantic Drift
- Coffee/beer/wine as categories of preparation
- Marcus's preference for "real coffee" as character trait
- Synthetic vs authentic as class markers

### 2. Vehicle Terms
- "Truck" as ground transport (semantic drift)
- Ships = spaceships (dominant usage)
- Natural evolution of terms

### 3. Technology Descriptions
- Old but still advanced (40-year-old haulers with antigrav)
- Natural integration without over-explaining
- Rhea as "old reliable" AI tech

## Minor Patterns

### Inconsistent But Acceptable
- Sometimes "credits," sometimes "certs" for currency
- Various terms for communication (call, ping, message)
- Mix of formal and casual language

### Natural Language Success
- Most clothing terms unchanged (jacket, suit, boots)
- Work terminology (salvage, authentication, contracts)
- Emotional/physical descriptions unchanged

## Priority Fixes

1. **High**: Phone → comm consistency
2. **High**: Earth-specific references (Ch 1, 8)
3. **Medium**: Stellarion → Brenner-Voigt completion
4. **Low**: Brand names (Armani, etc.)
5. **Low**: Breakfast scene synthetic ingredients

## Key Principle Reminder
The semantic drift principle means:
- Terms persist but meanings expand
- Dominant usage claims simple terms
- Old versions need qualifiers
- Don't over-explain evolved meanings
