# Chapter 001 Anachronism Review

## Food & Beverage

### Line 6: "beer that tasted like recycled water and barley"
- **Actually good as is**: Beer would persist as term for fermented grain beverages
- **The barley reference**: Could indicate this is "Earth-style" beer or just old habit of naming the grain
- **Natural approach**: Beer definitely persists, might not be Earth barley

### Line 12: "sausage gravy... cheese curds... tots"
- **Issue**: Very American diner food
- **Revision**: Already discussed - protein/synth versions
- **Natural approach**: Could keep familiar terms but show they're synthetic

### Line 36: "thermos of coffee (real beans, another port market luxury)"
- **Good as is**: Already shows coffee as rare/luxury, fits Marcus's character

## Technology

### Line 42: "I also just called you a car"
- **Issue**: "car" feels dated
- **Better**: "called you a ride" or "called a cab"
- **Natural**: People might still say "car" generically

### Line 68: "Same battered two-seater that always showed up"
- **Good**: Already feels futuristic (autonomous, Unit 7)

## Earth-Specific References

### Line 66: "late 20th century on Earth's smallest continent"
- **Major issue**: Too Earth-specific, makes Earth special
- **Revision**: "centuries back on some colony world" or just "centuries ago"

### Line 65: "pre-Collapse Earth"
- **Consider**: Is "Earth" needed here? Could be "pre-Collapse"

## Fashion/Clothing
- Minimal clothing references in this chapter
- "Flight suit" works as evolved terminology

## Language/Idioms

### Line 20: "that shit violates a boundary"
- **Natural**: Modern slang that could persist
- **Consider**: Might date the text eventually

### Line 75: "thunderstruck"
- **Works**: As a music reference/pun

## What Works Well

1. **Packrat ship description** - Great future tech that feels lived-in
2. **Container living** - Practical space-age housing
3. **Salvage yard details** - Feels authentic to setting
4. **AI partnership** - Natural integration

## Priority Fixes

1. **Line 66**: Remove specific Earth geography reference
2. **Line 12**: Adjust breakfast to synthetic versions
3. **Line 42**: Minor - "car" to "ride" or keep as is

## Overall Assessment
Chapter 1 is relatively clean of major anachronisms. Main issues are the Earth-specific geographic reference and the very American breakfast food. Most technology feels appropriately futuristic and worn.
