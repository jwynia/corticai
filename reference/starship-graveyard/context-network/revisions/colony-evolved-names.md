# Colony-Evolved Names for Starship Graveyard

## Principles for Galactic Colony Naming

### Linguistic Evolution Patterns
- Phonetic simplification over generations
- Merger of multiple Earth traditions
- New compounds based on colony life
- Professional surnames becoming common
- Location-based identifiers

### Examples of Evolution:
- Nguyen-Patel → Nupat
- Johansson-Lee → Joli
- Port Authority Worker → Portside
- Third Generation Miner → Threegen
- Night Shift Supervisor → Nightlead

## Revised Character Names

### Director [Previous: Chen/Kostova] → Director Solberg-Omu
- Scandinavian-Nigerian fusion
- Suggests multiple generation colony family
- No inherent "villainy" - just distinctive
- Could be shortened to "Sol-Omu" in casual use

### Jake → Jek Portside
- "Jake" evolved to "Jek" (linguistic drift)
- Surname from family's port worker history
- Working class marker

### Kit → Kit Threegen
- Third generation colonist
- Common colony surname pattern
- Indicates established but not elite family

### Other Adjustments:
- Prosecutor Vega → Prosecutor Vega-Tam (fusion name)
- Dr. Caine → Dr. Kaine (spelling drift)
- Meridian → stays (already sounds like colony callsign)

## Future Character Guidelines

1. **Fusion Names**: Combine 2-3 Earth origins unpredictably
2. **Drift Names**: Familiar sounds but altered spelling/pronunciation  
3. **Trade Names**: Based on colony professions
4. **Gen Names**: Indicating colonist generation
5. **Location Names**: From specific colony regions/facilities

This creates a naming ecosystem that:
- Feels evolved from Earth but not bound to it
- Helps readers track characters through distinctiveness
- Reflects actual linguistic evolution patterns
- Avoids both Earth-ethnic stereotypes and "alien" clichés
