# Chapter 002 Anachronism Review

## Technology

### Line 7: "his fingers danced through the AR projection"
- **Good**: AR (augmented reality) feels appropriately futuristic

### Line 43: "called you a car"
- **Minor issue**: "car" feels dated
- **Better**: "called you a ride" or "called a cab"
- **Natural approach**: Could keep "car" as generic term

### Line 113: "the reader's surface worn smooth as river stone"
- **Good**: Nice detail about worn tech still in use

## Fashion/Clothing
- Minimal clothing references
- "Coveralls" for dock workers is appropriately generic

## Food & Beverage

### Line 26: "burnt coffee, ozone from overworked processors"
- **Good**: Coffee exists but shown as institutional/bad quality

### Line 35-40: Coffee discussion
- **Good**: Shows Marcus bringing his own thermos of good coffee
- Fits the established character trait

## Earth-Specific References

### Line 65: "pre-Collapse Earth" 
- **Consider**: Does this make Earth too central to history?
- **Alternative**: Just "pre-Collapse" might work

### Line 82: "those Thornton butter cookies with real vanilla and cane sugar"
- **Good**: Shows real ingredients as luxury/contraband
- Fits the authentic vs synthetic theme

## Language

### Line 20: "that shit violates a boundary" (callback to Ch1)
- **Consistent**: Same modern slang usage

### Line 90: "credentials"
- **Good**: Generic term that works across time

## What Works Well

1. **Technology descriptions**: Feel futuristic but worn (tug controls, security systems)
2. **Emil Reeves introduction**: Personal connection without over-explaining
3. **Port atmosphere**: Gritty, industrial, multicultural
4. **Alien integration**: Crux species naturally part of port life

## Issues to Address

### Major
- None really major in this chapter

### Minor
1. **Line 43**: "car" â†’ "ride" or keep as is
2. **Line 65**: Consider if "Earth" reference needed

## Overall Assessment
Chapter 2 handles anachronisms much better than Chapter 1. The technology feels appropriately futuristic but worn, the coffee references support Marcus's established character trait, and the alien species are naturally integrated. The port setting allows for a mix of old and new tech that feels authentic.

## Best Examples to Emulate
- **Line 121**: "controls greeted him with honest simplicity"
- **Line 124**: Description of deep space vessel without over-explaining
- **Line 141**: Crux cultural differences shown through action
