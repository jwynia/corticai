# Refined Anachronism Revision Guide

## Core Principles

### 1. Evolutionary Realism
- Technology and culture evolve like organisms - some things change rapidly, others reach optimal form and persist
- "Shark evolution" principle: if it works perfectly, it doesn't change much
- Avoid change for change's sake

### 2. Semantic Drift Over Neologisms
- Familiar words acquire new meanings (phone → future comm device)
- Better to show future capabilities through action than invent new terms
- Readers naturally understand evolution of familiar concepts

### 3. Cultural Blending
- Like American culture blending European traditions into something new
- Earth traditions persist but evolved and mixed with other influences
- Most people won't know origins (like Americans and Christmas traditions)

### 4. Functional Description Over Material
- Describe what matters to the scene, not sci-fi materials
- "Weathered jacket" > "syn-leather jacket"
- If adding sci-fi prefix/suffix is the only change, skip it entirely

## Implementation Guidelines

### Technology Terms

#### Keep & Show Evolution
- **Phone** - Show future capabilities through use (holographic, neural, etc.)
- **Computer/Terminal** - Function matters more than quantum/nano prefixes
- **Vehicles** - Already established as hovering/repulsor-based

#### Simple Replacements
- **Kilometers** → **klicks** or **spans**
- **Miles** → Remove or use klicks
- **Specific Earth brands** → Generic descriptors

### Cultural Elements

#### Evolved Traditions
- **Wedding rings** → Keep rings, maybe programmable/responsive metal
- **Birthdays** → Life-cycle celebrations (might include multiple species' traditions)
- **Church** → **Temple** (more universal term)
- **Corporate quarters** → Blend with other planetary cycles

#### Time Systems
- **ISO Standard Time** - For contracts, shipping, interstellar coordination
- **Local orbital time** - For daily life, seasons
- Characters casually reference both

### Clothing & Fashion

#### Keep Simple
- Basic garments unchanged (shirts, pants, jackets)
- Focus on function/character not materials
- Describe what advances story (pockets for hiding, collars for warmth)

#### Avoid
- Sci-fi prefixes/suffixes without purpose
- Material descriptions unless plot-relevant
- Reinventing basic human clothing

### Food & Consumption

#### Already Established
- Coffee → Most drink synthetic, Marcus prefers "real"
- Meat → Lab-grown is norm, animal meat is strange
- Beer → Local fermented alternatives

#### Still Needed
- General synthetic food moment in early chapters
- Natural evolution, not heavy-handed exposition

## What NOT to Do

1. Don't add "cyber-", "neo-", "syn-" without purpose
2. Don't reinvent things that work fine (pants, doors, cups)
3. Don't explain every change - let context show evolution
4. Don't create words that sound like 1970s B-movie sci-fi

## Priority Order

1. Simple find/replace items (kilometers → klicks)
2. Phone/comm decision and implementation
3. Synthetic food establishment
4. Cultural evolution touches
5. Review clothing descriptions for unnecessary sci-fi-isms

## Remember

The goal is immersion in a lived-in future, not a museum of "future stuff." When in doubt, less is more.
