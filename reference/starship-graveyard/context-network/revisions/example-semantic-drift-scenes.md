# Example Semantic Drift Clarification Scenes

## Coffee Scene (Chapter 1 Addition)
**Current**: Marcus has coffee in his thermos
**Addition after he enters the port office**:

```
Quinnett's coffee maker gurgled in the corner, filling the air with a burnt smell that made Marcus grip his thermos tighter.

"Coffee?" she offered, already reaching for a mug.

"That's generous, calling it coffee." Marcus lifted his thermos. "I'll stick with mine."

"Real beans?" She whistled. "What's that cost now, week's salary?"

"Three days'. Worth it to actually taste coffee instead of roasted algae."

She shrugged, pouring herself the station-grown substitute. "Tastes like coffee to me."

"That's because you've never had the real thing."

"And whose fault is that? If Earth hadn't hoarded the last seedbanks..."
```

## Meat Scene (New Addition - Any Chapter)
**Context**: Team meal during planning

```
Jake pushed the protein around his plate. "At least the meat's decent."

"It's from those new Yamaha grow-tanks," Kit said. "Supposed to have better marbling."

"My kids won't even eat it if they know it's tank-grown. Keep asking for 'real' meat like in the stories." He shook his head. "Can you imagine? Killing an animal just to eat it?"

Marcus stayed quiet. He'd had real meat once, at a corporate dinner twenty years ago. The texture was... different. Wrong, almost. Like the muscle fibers knew they'd come from something that had moved, had lived. He'd been sick afterward, though whether from the meat or the knowledge, he couldn't say.

"Barbaric," Kit agreed. "Though I heard some frontier colonies still raise actual animals."

"Emergency protein," Jake corrected. "Not the same as farming them for food."
```

## Vehicle Scene (Chapter 2 Modification)
**Current**: "Marcus climbed into his truck"
**Revision**:

```
Marcus climbed into his truck, the old hauler's repulsors coughing before catching with a whine that said the gravitics needed alignment again. The vehicle rose with a slight list to starboard—another thing to fix when he had time and money, neither of which seemed likely.

He'd bought it from a Colonial Marines auction, back when they were updating their ground fleet. Twenty years old and ugly as sin, but the military-grade repulsors were rated for twice the load of civilian models. You could still see where the gun mounts had been welded over.

"Taking the truck?" Rhea asked through the speakers.

"Unless you've figured out how to make the Packrat hover at ground level."

"The power consumption would be—"

"I know. Just wishful thinking. This old beast'll have to do."
```

## Phone/Comm Clarification (Any Chapter)
**Simple addition when "phone" first appears**:

```
His phone buzzed—or comm, or whatever they were calling them these days. Marcus remembered when they were two different things, back when phones stayed in one place and comm units were military gear. Now everything was just "phone" to most people, even though they hadn't used actual phone lines in decades.
```

## Beer Scene Modification (Chapter 1)
**Current**: "beer that tasted like recycled water and barley"
**Slight revision**:

```
He'd sit up there with a beer that tasted like recycled water and barley—or whatever grain-substitute they were brewing with these days. The label claimed "Earth-style lager," which was marketing speak for "we programmed the tanks to approximate what beer used to taste like." Still, after a long day of breaking down ships, it did the job.
```

## Integration Notes

1. **Keep additions brief** - 3-4 lines max per clarification
2. **Make them conversational** - Natural dialogue or internal thoughts
3. **Front-load them** - Get major ones in first few chapters
4. **Use character-appropriate knowledge** - Marcus knows the differences
5. **Don't repeat** - Once established, trust the reader
