# Anachronism Revision Status

## Completed Revisions (as of July 2025)

### Phase 1: Quick Wins ✓

1. **Coffee Clarification** ✓
   - Chapter 1: "Real Earth beans this time, not the roasted algae most people called coffee"
   - Establishes Marcus's preference for real coffee as character trait
   - Shows most "coffee" is synthetic/algae-based

2. **Meat = Lab-grown** ✓
   - Chapter 1: "protein crumbles doing their best impression of meat"
   - Chapter 34: Discussion of protein farms, Marcus's aversion to "alive" meat
   - Successfully establishes lab-grown as norm

3. **Vehicle Technology** ✓
   - Chapter 2: "The cab settled onto its landing skids with a hydraulic hiss"
   - Multiple references to repulsors and hovering vehicles
   - Clear future tech without heavy-handed exposition

4. **Beer/Alcohol** ✓
   - Chapter 1: "beer that tasted like recycled water and that weird grain they fermented here"
   - Natural reference to local/synthetic alternatives

5. **Kilometers → Klicks** ✓
   - Chapter 10: "two kilometers" → "two klicks"
   - Chapter 11: "three kilometers" → "three klicks", "forty kilometers" → "forty klicks"
   - Chapter 13: All three instances converted
   - Chapter 14: "two hundred kilometers" → "two hundred klicks"
   - Chapter 34: "kilometers" → "klicks"

6. **Phone Usage** ✓
   - Decision: Keep "phone" with show-don't-tell approach
   - Chapter 2: Character "checking his phone" nervously - natural behavior needing no explanation
   - Allows semantic drift (like landline → smartphone evolution)

7. **Synthetic Food Establishment** ✓
   - Already present in Chapter 1 breakfast scene
   - "protein crumbles" naturally shows synthetic norm
   - No heavy-handed exposition needed

### Refined Approach Principles

1. **Evolutionary Realism**
   - Some tech/culture changes rapidly, others reach optimal form and persist
   - "Shark evolution" - if it works perfectly, don't change it

2. **Semantic Drift Over Neologisms**
   - Familiar words acquire new meanings naturally
   - Better to show capabilities than invent new terms

3. **Cultural Blending**
   - Earth traditions persist but evolved/mixed
   - Like American culture blending European traditions

4. **Functional Description Over Material**
   - "Weathered jacket" > "syn-leather jacket"
   - If only change is sci-fi prefix, skip it

### Additional Completed Items (July 2025)

8. **Cultural References** ✓
   - Church → temple (Chapter 24: "breaking glass in an empty temple")
   - Christmas → generic description (Chapter 19: "screen blazing with cascading notifications")
   - Prayer beads → worry stones (Chapter 24)
   - Wedding rings kept as-is (universal gesture, Jake spinning his ring)
   - Time references kept simple (Chapter 25: "daughter's wedding next month")

9. **Clothing Descriptions** ✓
   - Kept simple, functional descriptions
   - No unnecessary sci-fi prefixes added
   - Focus on what matters to scene (tie askew, suit jacket discarded)

10. **Corporate Terminology** ✓
   - Kept existing terms (quarterly earnings, Q3, insurance)
   - Works effectively to show contrast between profit and human cost
   - No forced space-commerce replacements needed

## Summary

- All simple find/replace items done (kilometers → klicks)
- Technology terms handled with semantic drift approach
- Food/beverage future context established
- Cultural references subtly updated
- Clothing kept functional without sci-fi prefixes
- Corporate terminology retained for thematic effect
- Overall approach based on "evolutionary realism" principle

## Next Steps
