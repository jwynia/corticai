# Chapter 005 Anachronism Review

## Technology

### Line 7: "tires squealing against asphalt"
- **Issue**: Wheeled vehicle with tires on asphalt
- **Consider**: Even old police cruisers would likely use repulsors
- **Alternative**: "repulsors whining against the landing grid" or similar

### Line 119: "electric sedan"
- **Good**: Electric is appropriately aged tech (not cutting edge)
- **Consider**: Might be "old electric sedan" to show it's outdated

### Line 122: "work phone"
- **Should be**: "work comm" for consistency

## Fashion/Clothing

### Line 29: "pale band of skin on her ring finger"
- **Good**: Marriage customs persisting, ring removal as universal sign

## Food & Beverage

### Line 45: "Coffee?"
- **Good**: Institutional coffee, not Marcus's preference

### Line 47: "smelled strong enough to dissolve tooth enamel"
- **Good**: Bad coffee as universal constant

## Earth-Specific References

### Line 7: "asphalt"
- **Consider**: Would roads still be asphalt? Maybe "permacrete" or just "road surface"

## Corporate Names

### Line 121: "STELLARION LEGAL"
- **Issue**: Still using "Stellarion" - should be "Brenner-Voigt Legal"
- This is one we identified as needing replacement

## What Works Well

1. **Safe house atmosphere** - Paranoia and exhaustion well portrayed
2. **Corporate threats** - Feel authentically bureaucratic
3. **Underground network** - Realistic resistance movement
4. **Tech descriptions** - Biometric locks, military-grade cases

## Issues to Address

### Major
1. **Line 7**: Wheeled police car on asphalt roads
2. **Line 121**: "Stellarion" should be "Brenner-Voigt"

### Minor
1. **Line 122**: "phone" â†’ "comm"

## Best Examples

### Good Future Tech (Line 113):
"The metal caught no light, treated with the same anti-reflective coating"
- Advanced but not over-explained

### Natural Dialogue (Line 164):
"How many people are in this network?"
- No exposition, lets context explain

## Overall Assessment
Chapter 5 has minimal anachronisms except for the wheeled vehicle at the beginning and the "Stellarion" name that needs updating. The corporate conspiracy feels authentic, technology is appropriately advanced but worn, and the underground network reads as realistic resistance rather than Hollywood action.
