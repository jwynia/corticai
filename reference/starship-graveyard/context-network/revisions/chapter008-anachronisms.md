# Chapter 008 Anachronism Review

## Technology

### Line 9: "staring at the suspension notice on her phone"
- **Issue**: "phone" should be "comm" for consistency
- **Easy fix**: "staring at the suspension notice on her comm"

## Fashion/Clothing

### Line 119: "Armani suit"
- **Issue**: Earth-specific designer brand
- **Better**: "expensive suit" or "Core-tailored suit"
- **Principle**: Brands likely wouldn't survive centuries unchanged

### Line 126: "his Armani suit"
- **Same issue**: Remove brand name

## Food & Beverage

### Line 5: "smelled of burnt coffee"
- **Good**: Coffee as generic bad smell, fits setting

## Earth-Specific References

### Line 119: "hand-carved wooden panels from Earth forests (extinct, but the wood remained)"
- **Major issue**: Makes Earth forests special/unique
- **Better options**:
  1. "hand-carved panels from extinct colony forests"
  2. "hand-carved panels from preserved timber"
  3. Just "hand-carved wooden panels" (origin unnecessary)
- **This is the example from our original search**

## Corporate Names
- No Stellarion references in this excerpt
- Brenner-Voigt used correctly

## What Works Well

1. **Corporate evil through bureaucracy** - Brilliantly done
2. **Institutional violence** - Shown through process, not action
3. **Financial web** - Complex but followable
4. **Character reactions** - Each person's professional identity crumbling

## Issues to Address

### Major
1. **Line 119**: "Earth forests" reference - too Earth-centric

### Minor  
1. **Line 9**: "phone" â†’ "comm"
2. **Lines 119, 126**: Remove "Armani" brand name

## Best Examples

### Corporate Doublespeak (Line 133):
"Given the structural risks and timeline pressures... Safety protocols must be our absolute priority"
- Perfect example of evil through euphemism

### Natural Tech Use (Line 47):
"Nothing on passive sensors, but I'm monitoring communication channels"
- Tech mentioned but not explained

### Semantic Drift (Line 119):
"leather chairs that whispered wealth"
- "Leather" used without qualification, could be any type

## Overall Assessment
Chapter 8 is mostly clean. The Earth forests reference is the most problematic - it makes Earth unnecessarily special. The brand names (Armani) date the text. Otherwise, the chapter brilliantly portrays corporate evil through bureaucratic language and the slow institutional destruction of the protagonists.
