# Director Name Analysis - Avoiding Median Clusters

## The Problem
- "Chen" = overused diverse villain
- "Kostova" = Eastern European villain (another clich√©)
- Need actual 50-95th percentile choice

## What Makes a Good Corporate Villain Name for This Setting?

### Context Clues:
- FAC (Frontier Archaeological Consortium) suggests academic/corporate hybrid
- Industrial colony setting
- Blue-collar protagonist vs white-collar antagonist
- Corporate archaeological exploitation

### Avoiding These Clusters:
- East Asian (Chen, Wong, Kim)
- Eastern European (Kostova, Volkov, Petrov)
- Generic Anglo corporate (Morrison, Henderson, Williams)
- Latin American drug lord crossover (Mendoza, Herrera)

## 50-95th Percentile Options:

### Director Okafor
- Nigerian (Africa's largest economy, underrepresented in SF)
- Suggests new money/emerging market corporate power
- Works against stereotype (African = victim, not power player)

### Director Lindqvist  
- Swedish (not the usual Scandinavian nice guy)
- Corporate raiders from social democracy background
- Unusual villain origin

### Director Achebe
- Igbo Nigerian (specific, not generic "African")
- Literary echo without being too precious
- Corporate intellectual predator

### Director Roux
- South African Afrikaner
- Mining/extraction corporate culture built in
- Complicated colonial history adding depth

### Director Yilmaz
- Turkish (bridge between East/West, underused)
- Ottoman empire echoes in archaeological exploitation
- Neither typical Western nor Eastern villain

## Recommendation: Director Achebe

Reasons:
1. Nigerian corporate power is realistic for space colonization era
2. Avoids both "diverse" and "default" villain tropes
3. Name has weight without being too exotic
4. Fits archaeological exploitation (cultural pillaging theme)
5. Actually in 50-95th percentile for SF villains

The name suggests someone who rose through academic/corporate ranks from a culture that understands both colonial exploitation and modern corporate power.
