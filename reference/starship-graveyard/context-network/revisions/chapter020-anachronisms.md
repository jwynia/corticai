# Chapter 020 Anachronism Review

## Technology

### Line 61: "His phone rang"
- **Issue**: Should be "comm" for consistency
- **Fix**: "His comm chimed" or similar

### Line 77: "His phone rang"
- **Same issue**: Change to "comm"

### Line 63: "Marcus started his truck"
- **OK with semantic drift**: "Truck" = ground transport hauler
- **Consistent with earlier decisions**

## What's Notable

### No "burner phone" reference found
- Initial report may have been incorrect
- Or it might be in a different part of the chapter

### Technology References
- Generally clean chapter from the excerpt
- Main issue is phone vs comm consistency

## Recommendations

1. Replace "phone" with "comm" throughout
2. Keep "truck" as established term for ground transport
