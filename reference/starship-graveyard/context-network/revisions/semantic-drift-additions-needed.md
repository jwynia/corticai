# Semantic Drift Clarifications Needed in Manuscript

## High Priority Additions

### 1. Coffee Clarification
**Current status**: Marcus's preference for real coffee established
**What's missing**: Clear indication that most "coffee" isn't from Earth
**Where to add**: Chapter 1 or 2, during coffee scene
**Suggested addition**:
```
"Want some coffee?" Quinnett asked.
"Real or regular?"
"You know what my budget is. It's the station-grown stuff."
"Then I'll stick with what I brought."
```

### 2. Meat Introduction
**Current status**: Not established
**What's missing**: Clear indication "meat" is lab-grown by default
**Where to add**: Any meal scene
**Suggested addition**:
```
"The meat's pretty good here."
"Lab-certified?"
"Is there any other kind? My grandfather used to talk about animal meat. Barbaric."
```

### 3. Truck/Vehicle Clarification
**Current status**: "Truck" used without indication it's not wheeled
**What's missing**: Brief indicator of repulsor/grav tech
**Where to add**: First vehicle use
**Suggested addition**:
```
Marcus climbed into his truck, the repulsors whining as they lifted the heavy vehicle.
```
OR
```
The truck settled onto its landing skids with a hydraulic hiss.
```

## Medium Priority

### 4. Phone/Comm Decision
**Current status**: Inconsistent usage
**Decision needed**: 
- Option A: Standardize to "comm"
- Option B: Keep "phone" but clarify once it means personal comm
**If Option B**:
```
His phone buzzed. Or comm unit, whatever people called them these days. The terms had blurred together like everything else from Earth.
```

### 5. Beer/Alcohol Clarification
**Current status**: "beer that tasted like recycled water and barley"
**Almost sufficient**: Just needs slight clarity
**Suggested tweak**:
```
"beer that tasted like recycled water and barley—though it probably hadn't seen real barley in decades"
```

## Low Priority

### 6. General Food Moment
**Purpose**: Establish synthetic as norm
**Where**: Any meal scene
**Example**:
```
The breakfast menu promised "authentic eggs" for triple the price of the regular synth. Marcus stuck with the regular. Authentic was a luxury for people without salvage yard mortgages.
```

### 7. Clothing/Materials
**Current**: "Real leather" mentioned
**Could add**: Brief moment showing synthetic is norm
**Example**:
```
"Nice jacket. Real leather?"
"Do I look rich? It's good synth though—you can barely tell."
```

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Prioritize early chapters** - Establish conventions before reader assumptions solidify
2. **One lantern per concept** - Don't over-explain once established
3. **Use natural moments** - Price comparisons, quality complaints, ordering scenes
4. **Character appropriate** - Marcus would know differences, others might not
5. **Keep it brief** - A line or two, not paragraphs

## Checklist for Implementation
- [x] Coffee clarification (Ch 1 - "Real Earth beans this time, not the roasted algae most people called coffee")
- [x] Meat = lab-grown (Ch 34 - cafeteria scene with discussion of protein farms vs. animal meat)
- [x] Truck/hauler has repulsors (Ch 2 - cab ride with repulsor details)
- [x] Phone/comm decision and clarification (Ch 3 - standardized to "phone" with semantic drift note)
- [x] Beer/alcohol minor tweak (Ch 1 - "synthetic barley—though the label claimed it was 'Earth-style lager'")
- [ ] One general food synthetic moment
- [ ] Optional: leather/clothing moment
