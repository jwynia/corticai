# Chapter 001 Breakfast Scene Revision

## Original Text
"sausage gravy, cheese curds, tots"

## Recommended Revision

### Full Scene Rewrite
"The morning special—protein crumbles in white sauce, synthetic cheese curds that squeaked against his teeth, and crispy root-hash. Marcus drowned it all in hot sauce, the capsaicin real enough even if nothing else was. The sign claimed 'traditional Earth breakfast,' but Earth hadn't seen real pork sausage in decades. Still, it filled the belly and the cook knew enough to make the synthetic gravy thick, not that watery stuff some places served."

### Alternative Shorter Version
"Protein gravy over synth-curds and tuber crisps—close enough to the real thing if you didn't think about it too hard. Marcus added extra hot sauce. At least the peppers were genuine."

### Character Development Version
"The breakfast plate arrived—mushroom protein doing its best impression of sausage, lab-grown cheese curds, and what the menu optimistically called 'heritage potato crisps.' Marcus had tasted the real versions exactly once, at that salvager's wedding where someone had blown their entire month's haul on authentic Earth food. These weren't that, but after three years, he'd stopped comparing. Mostly."

## Why This Works

1. **Maintains the comfort food aspect** - Still recognizable as hearty breakfast
2. **Shows the synthetic norm** - This is what everyone eats
3. **Character moment** - Marcus's practical acceptance with mild nostalgia
4. **Worldbuilding** - Earth foods extinct/rare, colonies make do
5. **Sensory details** - Squeaking cheese, thick gravy, hot sauce burn

## Additional Notes

- Hot sauce as the "real" element is perfect - spices being easier to grow/preserve/transport
- The "traditional Earth breakfast" sign adds irony and worldbuilding
- Marcus's attitude shows his practical nature - he complains but adapts
- Opens possibility for later scene where someone offers him "real" food as gift/bribe

## Implementation Checklist
- [ ] Replace original text in Chapter 001
- [ ] Check for other breakfast/meal references
- [ ] Ensure consistency with Marcus's character
- [ ] Add hot sauce preference to character notes
