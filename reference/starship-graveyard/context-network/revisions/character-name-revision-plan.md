# Character Name Revision Plan - Addressing Median Blindspots

## Detected Patterns

### The "Chen Outbreak"
- Director Chen (FAC) - falls directly into overused pattern
- Officer Chen (later changed to Torres) - compounded the issue

### Safe Diversity Clustering
Current names cluster in predictable "diverse but safe" patterns:
- Patel, Desai (South Asian cluster)
- Chen (East Asian predictable choice)
- Vega, Morganti (safe European/Hispanic choices)

### Missing Working-Class Naming Patterns
Few characters have:
- Industrial nicknames
- Colony-evolved names
- Working-class diminutives
- Trade-based surnames

## Revision Strategy (50-95th Percentile Approach)

### Immediate Critical Fix
**Director Chen → Director Kostova**
- Eastern European (less common in SF)
- Suggests corporate climber from industrial background
- Harsh consonants fit antagonist role

### Supporting Character Evolution

**Jake → Jake "Torque" Olszewski**
- Polish-American working class
- Nickname from mechanical expertise
- Reflects port industrial culture

**Kit → Kitra "Kit" Nkomo**
- South African heritage
- Technical documentation = preserving knowledge
- Less common than typical choices

**Prosecutor Vega → Prosecutor Delacroix**
- Louisiana Creole heritage  
- Suggests legal family tradition
- More distinctive than "Vega"

**Dr. Emerson → Dr. Rashidi**
- East African (less common than South Asian)
- Maintains mentor gravitas
- Avoids Anglo default

### New Character Guidelines

For future characters, consider:

1. **Colony Evolution Names**
   - Compound surnames (Patel-Morrison)
   - Phonetic drift (Nguyễn → Nwin)
   - Trade surnames (Scrapper, Venter, Portman)

2. **Industrial Culture Names**
   - Nicknames over given names
   - Tool/skill based identifiers
   - Shift-based surnames (Nightside, Daybreak)

3. **50-95th Percentile Sources**
   - Baltic states
   - West African (specific countries, not generic)
   - Indigenous fusion names
   - Pacific Islander
   - Working-class Celtic

## Implementation Priority

1. **Critical**: Fix Director Chen immediately (affects all remaining chapters)
2. **High**: Give Jake and Kit full names (they're core crew)
3. **Medium**: Adjust other recurring characters
4. **Low**: Background character diversity

## Validation Check
After revision, we should have:
- No more than one character from any specific ethnic cluster
- Mix of nickname/formal name usage reflecting class
- Names that tell mini-stories about colony history
- Phonetic variety avoiding repetitive sounds

## Remember
These aren't just diversity checkboxes - each name should reinforce the blue-collar, industrial colony setting where people are identified by what they do as much as where they're from.
