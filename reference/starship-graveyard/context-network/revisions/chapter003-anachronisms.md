# Chapter 003 Anachronism Review

## Technology

### Line 71: "phone buzzed against the workbench"
- **Consider**: "comm buzzed" would be more consistent
- **But**: Phone might persist as term (dominant usage)

### Line 151: "His phone buzzed again"
- **Same as above**: Consider "comm" for consistency

### Line 155: "climbed into his truck"
- **Actually OK**: "Truck" could remain as term for ground hauler
- **Semantic drift**: Like "phone" it stays but means something more advanced

## Fashion/Clothing

### Line 39: "work suit"
- **Good**: Generic term that would persist

### Line 155: "work pants"  
- **Good**: Natural, unmarked term

## Food & Beverage
- None in this chapter

## Earth-Specific References
- None noted

## What Works Well

1. **The locked ship mystery** - Quantum encryption feels futuristic
2. **Tool descriptions** - Plasma cutter, thermal lance (advanced but familiar)
3. **Container living** - Feels authentic to space-age life
4. **Technical details** - Good balance of future tech without over-explaining

## Minor Consistency Issues

1. **Phone vs comm** - Should probably standardize to "comm"
2. **Truck** - Actually fine to keep if understood as evolved term

## Best Examples

### Natural Tech Description (Line 48):
"The thermal lance felt solid in his hands as he powered it up"
- Advanced tool but described simply

### Failed Tech (Line 49-50):
"The cutting head melted before it made contact"
- Shows advanced materials without exposition

## Overall Assessment
Chapter 3 is very clean. The main "anachronism" (phone) could either be changed to "comm" for consistency or kept with the understanding that "phone" might persist as a term. The chapter does excellent job of showing advanced tech through problems and failures rather than exposition.
