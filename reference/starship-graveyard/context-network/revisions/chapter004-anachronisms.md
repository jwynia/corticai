# Chapter 004 Anachronism Review

## Technology

### Line 8: "green phosphor glow"
- **Good**: Old-style display tech that would still exist

### Line 9: "coffee had gone cold in the thermos"
- **Perfect**: Already established Marcus uses thermos for real coffee

### Communication Devices
- No "phone" references - clean chapter for comm tech

## Fashion/Clothing

### Line 17: "Her jacket was expensive but practicalâ€”real leather"
- **Consider**: "Real leather" could be shocking/rare in future
- **Semantic drift**: "Leather" might mean synthetic by default
- **Alternative**: Just "leather" or "her jacket was expensive but practical"

### Line 23: "The leather creaked softly"
- **Same as above**: Consider if real leather needs marking

## Food & Beverage

### Line 9: "cold coffee"
- **Good**: Consistent with Marcus's character

### Line 17: "sharp eyes the color of old coffee"
- **Good**: Coffee as color descriptor would persist

## Earth-Specific References
- None noted - clean chapter

## Corporate Names

### Line 107: "Drummond Cargo, Kovac Freight Solutions"
- **Good**: Already updated from original cliche names
- These feel appropriately industrial/grounded

## What Works Well

1. **Police interview tension** - Natural dialogue, no over-explaining
2. **Tech descriptions** - "green phosphor," old displays
3. **Character dynamics** - Past history revealed naturally
4. **No Earth-centrism** - Clean of specific Earth references

## Minor Considerations

1. **"Real leather"** - In a universe with semantic drift, might leather be assumed synthetic?
   - Could just say "leather" if it's the dominant type
   - Or "genuine leather" if marking it as special

## Best Examples

### Natural Tech Integration (Line 33):
"She pulled out a small tablet and stylus"
- Simple, no over-explanation

### Good Semantic Usage (Line 43):
"Breaking into ships is literally what I do for a living"
- "Ships" unmarked = spaceships (dominant usage)

## Overall Assessment
Chapter 4 is very clean. The only real question is whether "real leather" needs the qualifier or if leather has undergone semantic drift to mean any leather-like material. The chapter handles technology naturally, avoids Earth-specific references, and maintains good character voice throughout.
