# Major Changes Tracking - Starship Graveyard

## Critical Revisions Made

### 1. Consciousness Technology Removal (Chapters 15-31)
**Original**: Sites contained consciousness-transfer technology, pattern buffers, hive mind concepts
**Revised**: Sites are archaeological databases, industrial preservation systems
**Impact**: Maintains blue-collar realism, eliminates mystical elements

### 2. Scale Reduction
**Original**: 66 patients, 37 sites across 3 systems, galactic implications
**Revised**: 12 survivors, 5 local sites, regional impact only
**Impact**: Keeps stakes personal and manageable

### 3. Villain Motivation Change
**Original**: Cross pursuing human transformation/evolution
**Revised**: Cross covering up workplace safety violations
**Original**: Solari seeking consciousness technology
**Revised**: Solari desperate to pay criminal debts
**Impact**: Grounded in recognizable corporate greed

### 4. Character Naming Evolution
**Changed**:
- Director Chen → Director Solari (avoid clustering)
- Meridian Logistics → Hadal Logistics (avoid confusion)
- Jake → Jek "Jake" Portside (full name)
- Kit → Kitra "Kit" Threegen (full name)
- Officer Chen → Officer Torres (avoid duplication)

### 5. Marcus's Ability Explanation
**Original Concern**: Marcus might be "special" or "chosen"
**Final**: Marcus succeeds because he treats sites like broken equipment, not mystical artifacts
**Impact**: Preserves working-class protagonist

### 6. Corporate Structure Simplification
**Original**: Complex web of Stellarion, Halcyon, Pinnacle, FAC
**Final**: Stellarion (first villain), FAC (main villain), Halcyon (sometimes helpful)
**Impact**: Clearer antagonist structure

### 7. Ending Adjustment
**Original Plan**: 40 chapters
**Current**: 39 chapters (with new Chapter 25 false victory)
**Reasoning**: Natural conclusion reached, false victory chapter added for mystery depth

### 8. False Victory Chapter Addition (2025-07-19)
**Added**: New Chapter 25 "The Wrong Man"
**Impact**: Chapters 25-38 renumbered to 27-39
**Purpose**: Strengthen mystery with Kellerman frame-up and assassination
**Result**: Deeper conspiracy revealed, stakes escalated from fraud to existential threat
