### Validation Overview

The narrative validation process ensures that all story elements work together coherently, maintaining consistency across worldbuilding, character development, plot progression, and thematic expression.

### Core Validation Areas

#### 1. Worldbuilding Consistency
- **Physical Laws**: Technology and environment follow established rules
- **Chorus Technology**: Capabilities remain consistent across appearances
- **Setting Details**: Locations maintain consistent descriptions
- **Timeline Logic**: Historical events align properly

#### 2. Character Consistency
- **Voice**: Each character maintains distinct speech patterns
- **Knowledge**: Characters only know what they should know
- **Motivations**: Actions align with established goals
- **Growth**: Character development follows logical progression

#### 3. Plot Coherence
- **Cause and Effect**: Events follow logical sequences
- **Pacing**: Story rhythm maintains reader engagement
- **Stakes**: Consequences remain meaningful
- **Resolution**: Conflicts resolve satisfactorily

#### 4. Thematic Integrity
- **Core Themes**: Archaeological mystery remains central
- **Symbol Consistency**: Metaphors maintain meaning
- **Message Clarity**: Themes emerge naturally from story

### Validation Methods

#### Self-Review Checklist
Before considering any chapter complete:
- [ ] Read aloud for voice consistency
- [ ] Check timeline against master chronology
- [ ] Verify character knowledge limitations
- [ ] Confirm technology rules followed
- [ ] Validate thematic elements present

#### Cross-Reference Validation
1. Check against [world elements](../elements/world/) for worldbuilding rules
2. Verify character actions against [character elements](../elements/characters/) profiles
3. Confirm plot points align with [planning documents](../planning/) documents
4. Validate themes match [theme elements](../elements/themes/) framework

#### Common Issues to Check

**Worldbuilding Violations**
- Chorus tech doing something previously impossible
- Physics inconsistencies in space scenes
- Station layout contradictions

**Character Breaks**
- Marcus suddenly too trusting
- Dr. Zhou using non-academic language
- Maya's expertise exceeding established limits

**Plot Problems**
- Information appearing without source
- Timeline impossibilities
- Unmotivated character decisions

### Validation Workflow

1. **Chapter Draft Complete**
   - Run self-review checklist
   - Note any concerns

2. **Consistency Check**
   - Cross-reference with established elements
   - Update discovery records for findings

3. **Issue Resolution**
   - Fix identified problems
   - Update relevant documentation

4. **Final Validation**
   - Read full chapter in context
   - Verify all issues resolved

### Quality Standards

**Minimum Requirements**
- No worldbuilding contradictions
- Character voices distinct and consistent
- Plot follows logical progression
- Themes naturally integrated

**Excellence Indicators**
- Subtle foreshadowing properly placed
- Character growth feels organic
- World details enhance atmosphere
