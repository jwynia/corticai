# Editorial Framework Integration

## Classification
- **Domain**: Processes
- **Stability**: Stable
- **Abstraction**: Concrete
- **Confidence**: High

## Overview

Integration guide for connecting the prose-enhancement editorial framework with existing revision and validation processes.

## Framework Components

### Core Editorial Documents
1. **prose-enhancement.md** - Master framework establishing the three-layer rule
2. **sensory-detail-guide.md** - Strategic sensory deployment techniques
3. **character-reaction-guide.md** - Reaction chains and implication methods
4. **multi-function-sentence-guide.md** - Sentence construction patterns
5. **editorial-checklist.md** - Scene-by-scene implementation tool

## Integration Points

### With Revision Framework
- **Parent**: [[revision]] - Structural revision framework
- **Timing**: Editorial enhancement happens during final polish phase
- **Coordination**: Major revisions complete before prose enhancement
- **Validation**: Editorial changes must maintain revision consistency

### With Character Systems
- **Voice Consistency**: [[character-voice-guide]] filters all enhancements
- **Reaction Patterns**: Character-specific responses per [[character-reaction-guide]]
- **POV Maintenance**: Sensory details filtered through character perspective

### With World-Building
- **Consistency Checks**: No Earth-specific references unless historically relevant
- **Tech Level**: Descriptions match established technology
- **Sensory Palette**: Industrial/mechanical focus for blue-collar sci-fi

### With Validation
- **Quality Metrics**: 3+ senses per scene, 70%+ multi-function sentences
- **Genre Adherence**: Maintains blue-collar sci-fi noir tone
- **Pacing Preservation**: Enhancements don't slow critical moments

## Process Flow

1. **Complete structural revisions** (plot, character arcs, themes)
2. **Apply editorial framework** chapter by chapter
3. **Track metrics** using editorial-checklist.md
4. **Validate** against character voice and world consistency
5. **Final read** for flow and immersion

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Enhancement
- Purple prose from too many sensory details
- Reaction chains that slow pacing
- Forced multi-function sentences

### Under-Enhancement
- Missing emotional beats
- Generic sensory words
- Single-function dialogue

### Consistency Breaks
- Earth-specific references in off-world settings
- Character knowledge exceeding their experience
- Tech descriptions beyond established levels

## Measurement Standards

### Minimum Targets
- Sensory engagement: 3+ senses per scene
- Character reactions: 8-12 beats per 1000 words
- Multi-function sentences: 70%+ ratio

### Quality Indicators
- Reader immersion depth
- Character memorability
- Scene vividness without purple prose
