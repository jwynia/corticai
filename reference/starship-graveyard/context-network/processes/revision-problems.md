# Problem Detection and Intervention Protocol

## Purpose
Comprehensive guide for identifying revision problems early and implementing appropriate interventions to prevent story damage.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Process
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Abstraction:** Procedural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Problem Categories

### Character Consistency Breaks

**Warning Signs:**
- Character uses knowledge they shouldn't have
- Personality shifts without development
- Voice becomes generic or wrong
- Reactions don't match history
- Skills appear/disappear conveniently

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. When did character last feel authentic?
2. What specific behavior seems wrong?
3. Has intervening development been shown?
4. Are we seeing growth or error?

**Intervention Options:**
- **Minor:** Adjust dialogue/action to match established character
- **Major:** Add missing development scenes
- **Critical:** Roll back to last consistent state

### Plot Logic Failures

**Warning Signs:**
- Events happen without cause
- Timeline becomes impossible
- Information appears from nowhere
- Consequences don't follow actions
- Solutions feel unearned

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Can you trace clear cause-effect?
2. Does timeline mathematically work?
3. Where did characters learn this?
4. Why didn't they do this earlier?

**Intervention Options:**
- **Minor:** Add single line of explanation
- **Major:** Create new scene to establish logic
- **Critical:** Restructure sequence of events

### Pacing Disruptions

**Warning Signs:**
- Scenes drag without purpose
- Events rush without impact
- Rhythm becomes monotonous
- Tension dissipates unexpectedly
- Reader engagement likely drops

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. What is each scene accomplishing?
2. Are emotional beats given space?
3. Does variety exist in scene types?
4. Are promises being fulfilled timely?

**Intervention Options:**
- **Minor:** Trim or expand individual scenes
- **Major:** Reorder or combine scenes
- **Critical:** Restructure entire section

### Thematic Drift

**Warning Signs:**
- Theme becomes heavy-handed
- Core meaning gets muddled
- Story events contradict theme
- Symbols lose coherence
- Message feels forced

**Diagnostic Questions:**
1. Can you still state theme clearly?
2. Do events support or undermine theme?
3. Are symbols serving their purpose?
4. Is theme emerging or being pushed?

**Intervention Options:**
- **Minor:** Subtle dialogue adjustments
- **Major:** Realign plot events with theme
- **Critical:** Reconsider core thematic approach

## Early Detection Methods

### The Five-Chapter Check

Every 5 chapters during revision:

```markdown
## Five-Chapter Check - Chapters [X-Y]

### Coherence Review
- [ ] Characters consistent with earlier portrayal
- [ ] Plot events follow logically
- [ ] Timeline remains possible
- [ ] World rules maintained

### Quality Assessment
- [ ] Prose maintains voice
- [ ] Pacing feels appropriate
- [ ] Tension building/releasing well
- [ ] Theme developing naturally

### Red Flags
List any concerns, however minor

### Overall Confidence
High / Medium / Low
```

### The Read-Aloud Test

For detecting subtle problems:
1. Read revised section aloud
2. Note where you stumble
3. Mark unnatural dialogue
4. Identify rhythm issues
5. Catch repetitions

### The Summary Test

Can you clearly summarize:
- What changed and why?
- How characters are different?
- What story gains from revision?
- What readers will experience?

If struggling, revision may lack focus.

## Problem Severity Assessment

### Critical Problems (Immediate Action Required)

**Characteristics:**
- Story fundamentally broken
- Reader comprehension impossible
- Core premise undermined
- Multiple systems failing

**Response:**
- Stop all forward progress
- Document failure completely
- Consider rollback seriously
- Seek outside perspective

### Major Problems (Address Within 24 Hours)

**Characteristics:**
- Significant logic gaps
- Character authenticity damaged
- Pacing seriously disrupted
- Theme becoming incoherent

**Response:**
- Pause forward progress
- Focus on problem resolution
- Test multiple solutions
- Verify fix before proceeding

### Minor Problems (Track and Address Later)

**Characteristics:**
- Small consistency issues
- Polish-level concerns
- Enhancement opportunities
- Style inconsistencies

**Response:**
- Document in tracking system
- Continue forward progress
- Address in polish pass
- Batch similar fixes

## Intervention Decision Tree

```
Problem Detected
    |
    ├─> Can reader understand story?
    |       |
    |       No ──> CRITICAL: Stop and fix
    |       |
    |       Yes ─> Does it break character/logic?
    |                |
    |                No ──> Will it compound if ignored?
    |                |           |
    |                |           No ──> MINOR: Document and continue
    |                |           |
    |                |           Yes ─> MAJOR: Fix soon
    |                |
    |                Yes ─> MAJOR: Fix within 24 hours
```

## Rollback Decision Criteria

### When to Roll Back

**Hard Triggers (Automatic Rollback):**
- Core story purpose lost
- Multiple critical problems
- Cascade failures exceeding 20% of manuscript
- Character voices unrecoverable
- Plot logic irreparably broken

**Soft Triggers (Consider Rollback):**
- Fix requires more work than original
- Multiple major problems accumulating
- Lost clarity on revision purpose
- Energy/confidence depleted
- Deadline pressure creating poor decisions

### Rollback Procedure

1. **Stop Immediately**
   - Cease all revision work
   - Take break to gain perspective

2. **Document Thoroughly**
   ```markdown
   ## Rollback Decision - [Date]
   
   ### Trigger
   [What specific problem forced rollback]
   
   ### State at Failure
   - Chapters revised: [List]
   - Major changes made: [List]
   - Problems encountered: [List]
   
   ### Lessons Learned
   - What worked: [List]
   - What failed: [List]
   - Why it failed: [Analysis]
   
   ### Salvageable Elements
   - [Element 1]: Can be kept because...
   - [Element 2]: Worth trying again with...
   
   ### Next Approach
   [How to handle differently]
   ```

3. **Execute Rollback**
   - Revert to marked stable version
   - Keep rollback documentation
   - Save failed version for reference
   - Take time before re-attempting

## Prevention Strategies

### Pre-Revision Preparation
- Complete thorough analysis
- Set realistic scope
- Identify potential problems
- Create rollback points

### During Revision Discipline
- Make incremental changes
- Test frequently
- Document everything
- Monitor continuously

### Mental/Physical Health
- Take regular breaks
- Maintain perspective
- Accept imperfection
- Recognize fatigue signs

## Recovery Protocols

### After Minor Problems
1. Fix identified issue
2. Check for related problems
3. Update tracking documents
4. Continue with increased vigilance

### After Major Problems
1. Resolve core issue completely
2. Audit surrounding areas
3. Reassess revision approach
4. Proceed more cautiously

### After Rollback
1. Take sufficient break
2. Analyze failure thoroughly
3. Develop new approach
4. Start smaller next attempt

## Common Problem Patterns

### The Domino Effect
- One change breaks something
- Fix breaks something else
- Fixes multiply exponentially
- **Solution:** Stop, reassess, find root cause

### The Perfectionism Trap
- Endless tiny adjustments
- Lost sight of "good enough"
- Diminishing returns
- **Solution:** Set completion criteria

### The Scope Creep
- "While I'm here" additions
- Original goal forgotten
- Revision never ends
- **Solution:** Document and defer extras

### The Voice Drift
- Editing out personality
- Everything sounds same
- Lost original energy
- **Solution:** Re-read original voice
