# Revision Types Guide

## Purpose
Quick reference for identifying revision types and selecting appropriate protocols based on specific symptoms and goals.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Process
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Revision Type Decision Matrix

### Quick Diagnostic

Answer these questions to identify your revision type:

1. **What feels wrong?**
   - Characters → [Character Revision](#character-revisions)
   - Plot/Pacing → [Plot Revision](#plot-revisions)
   - Meaning/Message → [Theme Revision](#theme-revisions)
   - World consistency → [Worldbuilding Revision](#worldbuilding-revisions)
   - Writing quality → [Manuscript Revision](#manuscript-revisions)

2. **What level needs work?**
   - Core concept/meaning → Thematic Level
   - Story structure/events → Structural Level
   - Actual words/prose → Manuscript Level

3. **How extensive is the change?**
   - Single scene/chapter → Local Revision
   - Story section/act → Regional Revision
   - Entire manuscript → Global Revision
