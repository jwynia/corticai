## Classification
- **Domain:** Process
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Abstraction:** Procedural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Common Character Revision Triggers

### Symptoms Requiring Revision
- Character feels flat or one-dimensional
- Motivations unclear or unconvincing
- Arc incomplete or unsatisfying
- Voice inconsistent or generic
- Actions don't align with established personality
- Reader connection lacking
- Character serves plot rather than driving it

### Diagnostic Questions
Before revising, answer:
1. What specific aspect feels wrong?
2. When did the character last feel "right"?
3. What story purpose should they serve?
4. What change would make them compelling?

## Pre-Revision Character Audit

### Current State Mapping
Document across all chapters:

```markdown
## Character State Map: [Character Name]

### Chapter Appearances
Ch 1: Introduced as [role/impression]
Ch 3: Reveals [trait/backstory]
Ch 5: Makes decision to [action]
Ch 8: Relationship with [character] shifts
Ch 12: Major turning point: [event]
Ch 15: Current state: [description]

### Core Attributes
- Wants: [What they pursue]
- Needs: [What they actually require]
- Fears: [What they avoid]
- Lies: [What they believe incorrectly]
- Truth: [What they must learn]

### Relationship Dynamics
- With [Character A]: [Current state]
- With [Character B]: [Current state]
- With themselves: [Internal conflict]

### Voice Markers
- Speech patterns: [Examples]
- Behavioral tics: [Examples]
- Thought patterns: [Examples]
```

## Character Revision Types

### Type 1: Motivation Clarification

**When to Use:** Character actions feel unmotivated or arbitrary

**Process:**
1. Identify the unconvincing action
2. Trace back to establish deeper want/need
3. Plant seeds of motivation earlier
4. Ensure obstacles genuinely threaten their goals
5. Make stakes personal and specific

**Cascade Considerations:**
- Other characters' understanding of them
- Plot points depending on decisions
- Thematic connections to motivation

### Type 2: Arc Completion

**When to Use:** Character doesn't change meaningfully

**Process:**
1. Define starting point clearly
2. Identify specific growth moments
3. Create concrete challenges to beliefs
4. Show struggle with change
5. Demonstrate new behavior at climax

**Arc Waypoints:**
```markdown
### Growth Arc Tracking
1. **Establishment** (Ch X): Character believes/does [old way]
2. **First Challenge** (Ch Y): Encounters [situation] that questions belief
3. **Resistance** (Ch Z): Doubles down on old way, consequences worsen
4. **Breaking Point** (Ch A): Old way fails completely
5. **Tentative Change** (Ch B): Tries new approach, uncertain
6. **Commitment** (Ch C): Chooses new way despite cost
7. **Integration** (Ch D): New way becomes natural
```

### Type 3: Voice Distinctiveness

**When to Use:** Character sounds like others or narrator

**Process:**
1. Create voice document with:
   - Educational background influence
   - Regional/cultural markers
   - Emotional expression style
   - Favorite phrases/words
   - Sentence structure patterns

2. Apply consistently:
   - Dialogue patterns
   - Internal monologue style
   - Action descriptions
   - Emotional reactions

**Voice Checklist:**
- [ ] Could remove dialogue tags and still identify speaker?
- [ ] Does education level show in word choice?
- [ ] Are emotional expressions unique to them?
- [ ] Do they have verbal tics when stressed?

### Type 4: Relationship Dynamics

**When to Use:** Character relationships feel static

**Process:**
1. Map all relationship states
2. Identify stagnant connections
3. Create friction or bonding events
4. Show relationships affecting decisions
5. Evolve based on story events

**Dynamic Tracking:**
```markdown
### Relationship: [Character A] + [Character B]
Start: [Initial dynamic]
Ch X: [Event] causes [shift]
Ch Y: [New understanding] develops
Ch Z: [Conflict] tests relationship
End: [Final dynamic]
```

### Type 5: Internal Consistency

**When to Use:** Character acts out of character

**Process:**
1. Identify all inconsistent moments
2. Determine if growth or error
3. For errors: align with core traits
4. For growth: add missing steps
5. Ensure reactions match history

## Implementation Strategies

### The Layer Method
Revise in passes:
1. **Want/Need Pass**: Clarify driving forces
2. **Voice Pass**: Distinguish speech and thought
3. **Relationship Pass**: Evolve connections
4. **Arc Pass**: Strengthen change journey
5. **Polish Pass**: Enhance unique details

### The Thread Method
Follow single aspect through entire manuscript:
1. Pick one trait/motivation/relationship
2. Track through every appearance
3. Adjust for consistency and growth
4. Repeat for each major aspect

### The Scene Method
Revise character scene by scene:
1. Ensure scene goals clear
2. Check voice consistency
3. Verify relationship dynamics
4. Confirm arc progression
5. Move to next scene

## Common Cascade Effects

### When Changing Motivation
- Plot decisions may not make sense
- Other characters' reactions need adjustment
- Thematic connections might shift
- Backstory might need enhancement

### When Strengthening Arc
- Early establishment needs reinforcement
- Growth moments need emphasis
- Supporting characters' roles adjust
- Climax might need restructuring

### When Fixing Voice
- Every dialogue instance needs review
- Narrative passages in their POV
- Other characters' perceptions
- Internal monologue consistency

## Validation Specific to Character

### Character-Specific Checks
- [ ] Would they really say/do this?
- [ ] Does growth feel earned?
- [ ] Are relationships dynamic?
- [ ] Is voice distinctive?
- [ ] Do readers care about them?

### Beta Reader Questions
1. When did you first care about [character]?
2. What do you think they want most?
3. How did they change by the end?
4. Which relationships mattered most?
5. Did any actions surprise you?
