# Revision Monitoring Protocol

## Purpose
Systematic approach to tracking revision progress, detecting emerging issues, and maintaining quality throughout the revision process.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Process
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Abstraction:** Procedural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Monitoring Framework

### Continuous Monitoring Points

Monitor these elements throughout revision:

1. **Story Coherence**
   - Plot logic intact
   - Character consistency maintained
   - Timeline accuracy
   - World rules followed

2. **Revision Goals**
   - Original problem being solved
   - Success metrics improving
   - Unintended consequences minimal
   - Overall quality increasing

3. **Cascade Management**
   - Ripple effects identified
   - Tasks tracked and completed
   - New issues documented
   - Dependencies managed

4. **Work Progress**
   - Daily accomplishments
   - Blockers and challenges
   - Time estimates accurate
   - Energy/momentum sustained

## Monitoring Schedule

### Chapter-Level Review

After completing each chapter's revisions:

```markdown

- [ ] Pacing issues
- [ ] Theme disconnect
```

### Milestone Reviews

At major progress points:

```markdown
## Milestone Review - [Description]

### Overall Progress
- Revision started: [Date]
- Current status: X% complete
- Original timeline: On track/Ahead/Behind

### Goal Achievement
Primary Goal: [Status and assessment]
Secondary Goals: [Status list]

### Quality Metrics
- Story coherence: Improved/Maintained/Degraded
- Character depth: Improved/Maintained/Degraded
- Pacing: Improved/Maintained/Degraded
- Theme clarity: Improved/Maintained/Degraded

### Major Discoveries
1. [Insight about story/character/structure]
2. [Unexpected improvement opportunity]
3. [Systemic issue identified]

### Approach Adjustments
- Continue as planned
- Minor adjustments: [List]
- Major pivot needed: [Description]
```

## Issue Detection and Classification

### Issue Severity Levels

**Critical (Stop and Fix)**
- Plot logic completely breaks
- Character acts impossibly out of character
- Timeline becomes impossible
- Core story purpose undermined

**Major (Address Soon)**
- Significant coherence problems
- Multiple cascade failures
- Reader confusion likely
- Thematic contradictions

**Minor (Note and Continue)**
- Small consistency issues
- Polish-level problems
- Enhancement opportunities
- Nice-to-have improvements

### Early Warning Signs

Watch for these patterns:

1. **Revision Fatigue Indicators**
   - Making changes for change's sake
   - Losing sight of original goals
   - Second-guessing everything
   - Perfectionism paralysis

2. **Scope Creep Warnings**
   - "While I'm here" additions multiply
   - Original problem forgotten
   - Revision expanding beyond plan
   - Timeline slipping significantly

3. **Coherence Breakdown Signals**
   - Can't remember what changed where
   - Contradictions appearing
   - Lost track of character states
   - Confusion about current version

4. **Quality Degradation Signs**
   - Prose becoming lifeless
   - Dialogue losing distinctiveness
   - Pacing becoming mechanical
   - Theme getting muddled

## Monitoring Tools

### The Change Log

Track every significant change:

```markdown
## Change Log - [Date]

### Chapter X
- Changed: [Specific edit]
- Reason: [Why needed]
- Cascades to: Ch Y, Z

### Chapter Y
- Changed: [Specific edit]
- Reason: [Cascade from X]
- Cascades to: None
```

### The Consistency Tracker

Monitor key story elements:

```markdown
## Consistency Tracking

### Character States
[Character]: 
- Ch 10: Knows [X], believes [Y]
- Ch 15: Learns [Z], questions [Y]
- Ch 20: Must still not know [A]

### Timeline Markers
- Day 1: [Event] (Ch 1-3)
- Day 5: [Event] (Ch 8)
- Day 10: [Event] (Ch 15)
[Check: Do travel times work?]

### World Rules
- Chorus limit: [Established rule]
- Violated in: [None/Chapter list]
- Needs adjustment: [Yes/No]
```

### The Energy Monitor

Track your work patterns:

```markdown
## Energy Tracking - Week of [Date]

### Productive Sessions
- [Day]: [Hours] - [What accomplished]
- [Day]: [Hours] - [What accomplished]

### Struggle Points
- [Task]: Why difficult
- [Task]: Why difficult

### Insights
- Best time to work: [Time]
- Most productive on: [Task type]
- Need breaks after: [Duration]
```

## Response Protocols

### When Issues Detected

1. **Assess Severity**
   - Use classification system
   - Consider story impact
   - Evaluate fix difficulty

2. **Document Thoroughly**
   - What exactly is wrong
   - Where it appears
   - Why it matters
   - Potential solutions

3. **Decide Response**
   - Fix immediately (Critical)
   - Schedule fix (Major)
   - Add to polish list (Minor)
   - Accept and move on (Trivial)

### When Progress Stalls

1. **Identify Block Type**
   - Technical (don't know how)
   - Creative (don't know what)
   - Energy (too tired/overwhelmed)
   - Perfectionism (won't move on)

2. **Apply Appropriate Solution**
   - Technical: Research, ask for help
   - Creative: Brainstorm, take break
   - Energy: Rest, reduce scope
   - Perfectionism: Set "good enough" bar

### When Scope Expands

1. **Reassess Goals**
   - Original problem still focus?
   - New changes necessary?
   - Time/energy available?

2. **Make Hard Choices**
   - Defer non-critical changes
   - Document ideas for later
   - Focus on core revision
   - Set firm boundaries

## Integration with Revision Process

Monitoring feeds back into:
- [Revision Records](revision-records.md) - Documents findings
- [Problem Detection](revision-problems.md) - Identifies issues
- [Implementation](revision-implementation.md) - Adjusts approach
- [Cascade Management](revision-cascades.md) - Tracks ripples

## Relationships
- **Parent Node:** [revision.md]
- **Related Nodes:**
  - [revision-problems.md] - detects - Monitoring identifies problems
  - [revision-records.md] - updates - Monitoring updates records
  - [validation.md] - feeds - Monitoring ensures validation
