# Chapter 1 - Editorial Enhancement Sample (Revised for World Consistency)

## Original Section (Lines 8-14)

> Inside that shipping container, Marcus sat on the toilet, shaving, using the sink and staring at his own dark-skinned face contrasting sharply with the shaving cream covering half of it in the small, arm-mounted mirror jutting out directly in front of him.
> 
> The bathroom of one of the living module containers for the Packrat shipping system was pretty cramped. But, it made up for it in being really comfortable everywhere else. And, the large shower that took up the rest of the bathroom space was like a red star solar flare scraping the entire atmosphere off a planet when it came to getting rid of the dirt and grime from a day taking ships apart. So, worth it.
> 
> As he finished the left side of his face and started the right, the timer on his air fryer dinged, indicating the tots were done. He hurried through the rest of his shave to get back to the kitchen. He gave the sausage gravy a stir, grabbed the scrambled eggs from the synthesizer and poured them into the pan, put a layer of cheese curds on the tots and put them back in the air fryer, and returned to the eggs, stirring to get them exactly how he liked them.
> 
> A few minutes later, another ding and a one more stir of the eggs and the gravy and everything was ready to plate. A layer of tots, the layer of melted cheese, a layer of scrambled eggs, a layer of gravy and a sprinkle of chives and it looked almost exactly like the video he'd seen last night.

## Enhanced Version (World-Consistent)

> Inside that shipping container, recycled air humming through the vents with its familiar metallic tang, Marcus perched on the toilet-sink combo that passed for a bathroom in most orbital-rated modules, dragging the razor across his jaw while the shaving cream's antiseptic mint fought a losing battle against the smell of sausage gravy drifting from the kitchen. His dark skin caught the harsh LED light in the arm-mounted mirror—the same unforgiving glare that had shown him every new line earned in the five years since he'd fled his corporate cubicle for this salvage yard.
> 
> The bathroom pressed in on all sides, standard Packrat dimensions that some Pinnacle designer had calculated to the millimeter for maximum profit per cubic meter. But the rest of the container sprawled in relative luxury, and the shower—that industrial-grade decon unit could strip paint, grime, and bad decisions with equal efficiency. After a day elbow-deep in drive cores and hydraulic fluid, feeling that scalding water blast away the evidence was worth any amount of morning contortions.
> 
> The air fryer's sharp ding cut through his concentration mid-stroke. He cursed, dabbing at the nick that welled red against the white foam, then rushed the rest of his shave with practiced strokes his hands could manage while his mind had already moved to the kitchen. The sausage gravy bubbled with little volcanic pops that sent pepper-scented steam curling up—he gave it a quick stir with the wooden spoon he'd carved from a piece of actual wood salvage, the handle worn smooth by his grip. The synthesizer dispensed its eggs with a wet plop that always made him wince, but once they hit the hot pan with that satisfying sizzle, they transformed into something real. The cheese curds—proper cultured ones from that Demeter-system dairy co-op at the port market—went onto the tots, and back into the fryer they went while he worked the eggs, folding and stirring with the focus of a man who knew the difference between perfect scramble and protein paste.
> 
> Another ding, another stir—muscle memory guiding his hands while anticipation built in his stomach. He assembled the layers with the reverence of those food-vid hosts on the culture channels: golden tots crunching under his spoon, cheese pulling in satisfying strings, eggs fluffy as atmospheric foam, gravy thick enough to coat but thin enough to seep into every crevice, and fresh chives from his counter garden adding that sharp green note that made the whole thing sing. It looked almost exactly like the video he'd seen last night, down to the way the gravy pooled at the edges—except this was real, immediate, and about to solve every problem his morning brain hadn't identified yet.

## Key World-Building Adjustments

### References Changed:
- ~~"Wisconsin-style"~~ → "proper cultured ones from that Demeter-system dairy co-op"
- ~~"Terran oak"~~ → "actual wood salvage" (keeping it vague since wood is rare)
- "corporate cubicle" → stays generic but relatable
- "orbital-rated modules" → establishes space-faring context
- "Pinnacle designer" → references the established company
- "industrial-grade decon unit" → more fitting than just "shower"

### Maintained Enhancements:
- All sensory details (metallic tang, volcanic pops, etc.)
- Character reactions and physical responses
- Multi-function sentences
- Blue-collar voice and perspective

## Additional World-Consistent Enhancement Example

### Original (Line 50):
> Marcus had noticed something in a few of those photos - certain pieces of salvage caught the light differently, the way quality materials did when you knew what to look for.

### Enhanced (World-Consistent):
> Marcus had noticed something in a few of those photos—certain pieces of salvage caught the light differently, the way military-grade composites or pre-Collapse alloys did when you knew what to look for. The photographer had called it interesting composition, but Marcus recognized it instantly: that subtle blue sheen of quantum-locked metals, the too-perfect surface of self-healing hull plating. Those were always the pieces that turned out to have the best components or rare materials. Nothing special about it—just five years of handling enough scrap to know when you'd found something the big corps had spent real money on.

### Analysis:
- Replaces generic "quality materials" with specific sci-fi materials
- Adds technical details (quantum-locked metals, self-healing hull plating)
- References "pre-Collapse" suggesting historical depth
- Maintains character expertise while building world

## Editorial Note for World Consistency

When enhancing prose in sci-fi settings:

1. **Replace Earth-specific references** with:
   - System/planet names from your universe
   - Generic but evocative descriptions
   - Tech-appropriate alternatives

2. **Use world-specific details** for:
   - Food sources (co-ops, synthesizers, culture channels)
   - Materials (composites, alloys, salvage)
   - Measurements (cubic meters, standard dimensions)
   - History (pre-Collapse, corporate systems)

3. **Maintain universals**:
   - Human reactions and emotions
   - Basic physics (within your world's rules)
   - Relatable experiences (morning routines, food comfort)
   - Working-class perspectives
