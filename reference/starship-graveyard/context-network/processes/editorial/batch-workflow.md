# Editorial Batch Processing Workflow

## Classification
- **Domain**: Editorial
- **Stability**: Stable
- **Abstraction**: Concrete
- **Confidence**: High

## Overview

Optimized workflow for processing 2-3 chapters per editing session, maintaining quality while building momentum across the 38-chapter manuscript.

## Pre-Session Checklist

### 30 Minutes Before
- [ ] Review previous session's notes
- [ ] Check continuity items flagged
- [ ] Load character reaction templates
- [ ] Refresh sensory palettes
- [ ] Clear workspace/close other apps
- [ ] Have coffee/water ready

### Session Setup (10 minutes)
1. Open files:
   - Current chapters to edit
   - Editorial progress log
   - Character/sensory templates
   - Previous chapter (for continuity)

2. Quick review:
   - Where did last chapter end?
   - Which characters appear?
   - What threads continue?
   - Any setups needing payoff?

## Chapter Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1: Rapid Assessment & Enhancement Planning (20 min/chapter)
- [ ] Speed-read for overall flow
- [ ] Score current state (1-10 for each area)
- [ ] Apply diagnostic-driven treatment approach:
  - **Intensive Care (1-3 scores)**: Address severe deficits, may need 40-60% increase
  - **Targeted Enhancement (4-6 scores)**: Fix specific weaknesses, typically 15-30%
  - **Preservation Mode (7-10 scores)**: Light polish only, 5-15% maximum
- [ ] Assess chapter purpose: What job does this chapter do for the story?
- [ ] Mark enhancement levels:
  - ⭐⭐⭐ Full enhancement (3-4 scenes, 150-200w each)
  - ⭐⭐ Moderate enhancement (6-8 touches, 50-75w each)
  - ⭐ Light polish (scattered, 100-200w total)
- [ ] Verify enhancement budget doesn't exceed 25% increase

### Stage 2: Selective Enhancement Passes (45-60 min/chapter)

#### Priority: ⭐⭐⭐ Full Enhancement (25-30 min)
Apply all three lenses to marked critical scenes:
- **Major plot moments** (revelations, turning points)
- **First appearance of important locations**
- **Emotional peaks and character decisions**
- **Chapter climaxes**

Target: 150-200 words per scene, 3-4 scenes maximum

#### Secondary: ⭐⭐ Moderate Enhancement (15-20 min)
Apply 1-2 lenses selectively:
- **Secondary emotional beats**
- **Supporting character moments**
- **Important transitions**
- **Setup scenes**

Target: 50-75 words per touch, 6-8 touches maximum

#### Finishing: ⭐ Light Polish (5-10 min)
Single touches throughout:
- Replace one "was" with sensory verb
- Add one gesture to dialogue
- Combine two adjacent sentences
- One specific detail per routine scene

Target: 100-200 words total scattered across chapter

### Stage 3: Integration Review (15 min/chapter)
- [ ] Read-through for flow
- [ ] Check voice consistency
- [ ] Verify pacing maintained
- [ ] Confirm word count within 25% target
- [ ] Ensure enhanced moments feel special, not exhausting
- [ ] Update progress metrics
- [ ] Flag any issues found

## Batch Rhythm Management

### 2-Chapter Sessions (Recommended)
**Hour 1**: Chapter 1 assessment + sensory pass
**Hour 2**: Chapter 1 reaction + efficiency passes
**Break**: 15 minutes (move around, rest eyes)
**Hour 3**: Chapter 2 full processing
**Hour 4**: Both chapters review + logging

### 3-Chapter Sessions (Experienced)
**Hour 1**: All assessments + Chapter 1 sensory
**Hour 2**: Chapter 1 complete + Chapter 2 sensory
**Hour 3**: Chapter 2 complete
**Break**: 20 minutes
**Hour 4**: Chapter 3 complete
**Hour 5**: Full review + documentation

## Efficiency Accelerators

### Keyboard Shortcuts Setup
- Find/Replace: Common words (was, had, very)
- Navigation: Jump between [MARKERS]
- Templates: Quick insert templates

### Common Replacements
| Find | Replace With |
|------|--------------|
| "was [verb]ing" | [active verb] |
| "started to" | [direct action] |
| "felt" | [show feeling] |
| "looked" | [specific gaze] |
| "walked" | [specific movement] |

### Speed Patterns
1. **Dialogue Enhancement**:
   - "said" → "said, [gesture]"
   - End with action not tag
   - Interrupt with movement

2. **Setting Enhancement**:
   - Add one sense per paragraph
   - Include wear/damage details
   - Note temperature/light

3. **Transition Enhancement**:
   - Sensory shift
   - Time marker
   - Movement bridge

## Quality Control Speed Checks

### Red Flags (Fix Immediately)
- Earth-specific references
- Character name errors
- Tech inconsistencies
- Lost plot threads
- Word count exceeding diagnostic prescription
- Every paragraph enhanced (over-enhancement)
- Treating 7+ score areas as if they were deficient
- Ignoring chapter purpose in favor of uniform treatment

### Yellow Flags (Note for Later)
- Slightly slow pacing
- Repetitive gestures
- Similar sentence starts
- Weak scene endings
- Enhancement feeling evenly distributed
- Reader fatigue from constant detail

### Green Lights (Working Well)
- Voice sounds right
- Scenes feel immersive
- Characters react naturally
- Pages turn themselves
- Clear peaks and valleys in enhancement intensity
- Enhanced moments feel special, not exhausting
- Word count stays within 20-25% increase

## Momentum Maintenance

### Between Sessions
- Leave clear stopping point
- Write one-line summary of next chapter
- Note any concerns while fresh
- Set next session time immediately

### Weekly Review
- Update overall progress percentage
- Identify pattern refinements
- Celebrate completions
- Adjust pace if needed

### Motivation Tracking
- Words enhanced per hour
- Improvement scores
- Reader-ready chapters
- Percent complete

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If Stuck on a Scene
1. Skip and mark [RETURN]
2. Process easier scenes first
3. Return with fresh perspective
4. Ask: What's the scene's job?

### If Voice Feels Wrong
1. Re-read previous chapter
2. Check character template
3. Read dialogue aloud
4. Simplify enhancements

### If Progress Slows
1. Reduce batch to 1 chapter
2. Focus on one enhancement type
3. Take longer break
4. Review successes for motivation

### If Continuity Breaks
1. Stop immediately
2. Document all issues
3. Fix before proceeding
4. Update tracking system
