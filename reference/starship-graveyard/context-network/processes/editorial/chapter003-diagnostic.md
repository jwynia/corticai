# Chapter 3 Diagnostic - "The Locked Ship"

## Classification
- **Domain**: Editorial
- **Stability**: Dynamic
- **Abstraction**: Concrete
- **Confidence**: High

## Initial Assessment

### Overall Scores (Pre-Enhancement)
- **Sensory Details**: 6/10
- **Character Reactions**: 7/10
- **Prose Efficiency**: 6/10

### Chapter Summary
Marcus brings the Serval to the salvage yard and attempts to breach its advanced security. After multiple failed attempts, he exploits a thermal differential between repair work and original hull. Inside, he discovers his mentor Dr. Reeves dead, evidence of massive corporate fraud, and realizes he's been set up. Detective Oriz arrives suspiciously quickly, forcing Marcus into a dangerous position.

## Sensory Analysis

### Current Strengths
- Good tactile details (thermal lance melting, suit breach)
- Some effective visual imagery (yellow-green gas, blood spatter arc)
- Physical sensations of paralytic agent effects

### Missing Elements
- Limited smell/taste beyond basic mentions
- Minimal temperature sensations
- Lack of environmental sounds during tense moments
- Missing textural details of equipment and surfaces
- No sensory anchoring for emotional transitions

### Priority Scenes for Sensory Enhancement
1. **Landing sequence** - Add mechanical sounds, hydraulic sensations
2. **Failed breach attempts** - Layer in ozone, metal heat, electromagnetic sensations
3. **Interior discovery** - Stale air, blood smell, electronic hum
4. **Body examination** - Death smell, cold skin, forensic details
5. **Oriz confrontation** - Desert wind, skimmer engines, tension in air

## Character Reaction Analysis

### Current Strengths
- Marcus's shock at finding Reeves is well-portrayed
- Physical reactions to paralytic agent
- Some good internal processing of implications

### Missing Elements
- Limited micro-reactions during breach attempts
- Insufficient physical tells during Oriz confrontation
- Missing Rhea's emotional responses to danger
- Lack of muscle memory details during equipment use
- Need more subtext in dialogue exchanges

### Priority Reaction Points
1. **First failed breach** - Show frustration physically
2. **Recognizing Reeves's security** - Full-body response
3. **Finding the body** - Layered shock (physical → emotional → analytical)
4. **Pocketing the shard** - Weight of decision in gesture
5. **Lying to Oriz** - Physical tells vs. control

## Prose Efficiency Analysis

### Current Issues
- Some single-function sentences that could carry more weight
- Opportunities to merge action and description
- Several "telling" moments that could "show"
- Redundant explanations that slow pacing

### Enhancement Opportunities
1. Combine equipment checks with character state
2. Merge technical explanations with sensory experience
3. Load dialogue with subtext and physical business
4. Use environment to reflect emotional states
5. Pack more world-building into action sequences

## Key Patterns to Maintain

### From Previous Chapters
- Marcus's ADHD traits (finger drumming, focus patterns)
- Coffee thermos as comfort object (though less relevant here)
- Rhea's voice modulations indicating mood
- Industrial/technical vocabulary
- Physical comedy balancing tension

### New Patterns to Establish
- Marcus's salvage expertise through sensory details
- His relationship with Reeves through memory flashes
- The weight of moral decisions through physical sensation
- Oriz as formidable investigator through observed details

## Specific Line-Level Issues

### Weak Openings
- "Marcus killed the tug's engines" - Could pack in sensation
- "He sealed his work suit" - Missing ritual/texture
- "Inside, emergency lighting cast" - Needs immediate sensory impact

### Missed Multi-Function Opportunities
- Equipment descriptions that don't advance character
- Dialogue that only conveys information
- Action sequences lacking emotional undertone

### Continuity Items
- Maintain "real coffee as luxury" theme
- Reference Marcus's criminal past subtly
- Keep Rhea's personality consistent
- Build on established salvage yard atmosphere

## Enhancement Priority List

### Must Fix
1. Sensory poverty in breach sequence
2. Insufficient physical reactions to finding Reeves
3. Weak tension building during Oriz arrival
4. Missing smell/taste throughout
5. Flat dialogue exchanges need subtext

### Should Enhance
1. Opening landing sequence atmosphere
2. Equipment failure frustrations
3. Interior environment details
4. Marcus's decision-making process
5. Chapter ending punch

### Nice to Have
1. More world-building through sensory details
2. Deeper Rhea personality moments
3. Additional texture in technical sequences
4. Subtle foreshadowing elements

## Session Plan

### Time Allocation (2 hours)
- 15 min: Initial read and markup
- 25 min: Sensory enhancement pass
- 25 min: Character reaction pass
- 25 min: Prose efficiency pass
- 15 min: Integration review
- 15 min: Final polish and logging

### Expected Outcomes
- Sensory: 6→9 (focus on smell, sound, texture)
- Reactions: 7→9 (add micro-expressions, physical tells)
- Efficiency: 6→9 (combine sentences, load meaning)
- Word count: ~3,800→~4,500 (+18-20%)
