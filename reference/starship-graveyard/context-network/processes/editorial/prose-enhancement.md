# Prose Enhancement Editorial Framework

## Classification
- **Domain**: Editorial
- **Stability**: Evolving
- **Abstraction**: Concrete
- **Confidence**: High

## Overview

A systematic framework for addressing common prose-level issues during line editing, focusing on three core enhancement areas:
1. Sensory detail enrichment
2. Character reaction and implication
3. Multi-function sentence construction

## Core Principles

### The Three-Layer Rule
Every scene should engage readers on three levels simultaneously:
- **Physical**: What can be sensed (seen, heard, smelled, touched, tasted)
- **Emotional**: How characters react internally and externally
- **Narrative**: How each element advances plot, character, or theme

### The Efficiency Principle
Strong prose makes every word earn its place by serving multiple narrative functions.

## Enhancement Areas

### 1. Sensory Detail Enhancement

#### Diagnostic Questions
- Can the reader place themselves physically in the scene?
- Are at least 3 senses engaged per scene?
- Do sensory details reflect POV character's state of mind?
- Are sensory descriptions doing work beyond mere description?

#### Implementation Strategies
- **Sensory Anchoring**: Begin scenes with a dominant sensory impression
- **Environmental Storytelling**: Use sensory details to reveal character/setting history
- **Emotional Mirroring**: Match sensory descriptions to emotional tone
- **Contrast and Change**: Show scene progression through shifting sensory details

#### Red Flags
- Visual-only descriptions
- Generic sensory words (hot, cold, loud, quiet)
- Sensory details that don't connect to character experience
- Missing environmental atmosphere

### 2. Character Reaction and Implication

#### Diagnostic Questions
- Does every significant event trigger a character response?
- Are both internal and external reactions shown?
- Do reactions reveal character growth/change?
- Are implications clear without being stated?

#### Implementation Strategies
- **Reaction Chain**: Event → Physical Response → Emotional Response → Decision/Action
- **Subtext Layering**: What they do/say vs. what they think/feel
- **Micro-Reactions**: Small gestures/expressions that reveal larger emotions
- **Delayed Reactions**: Show processing time for significant events

#### Red Flags
- Events happening in emotional vacuum
- Characters as passive observers
- Missing internal monologue in key moments
- Telling emotions instead of showing reactions

### 3. Multi-Function Sentences

#### Diagnostic Questions
- Does each sentence advance plot, character, or theme?
- Are descriptions also revealing character/mood/tension?
- Do action sentences include emotional/sensory elements?
- Is dialogue doing more than conveying information?

#### Implementation Strategies
- **Fusion Technique**: Combine action + emotion + sensory in single sentences
- **Loaded Details**: Choose specific details that carry thematic weight
- **Active Voice Priority**: Ensure subjects drive sentences forward
- **Rhythm Variation**: Mix sentence lengths for pacing control

#### Red Flags
- Single-purpose sentences (pure description, pure action)
- Dialogue serving only as information delivery
- Passive constructions hiding character agency
- Repetitive sentence structures

## Application Process

### Phase 1: Scene Audit
1. Read scene for overall impact
2. Mark sensory gaps with [SENSE]
3. Mark missing reactions with [REACT]
4. Mark single-function sentences with [MULTI]

### Phase 2: Enhancement Planning
1. Identify POV character's emotional state
2. List available senses for the environment
3. Map character goals and obstacles
4. Note thematic elements to reinforce

### Phase 3: Revision Implementation
1. Address [SENSE] marks by adding contextual sensory details
2. Address [REACT] marks by showing character processing
3. Address [MULTI] marks by combining elements
4. Read revised scene for flow and coherence

### Phase 4: Integration Check
1. Ensure new elements maintain voice consistency
2. Verify pacing hasn't been compromised
3. Confirm genre expectations are met
4. Check for overwriting or purple prose

## Genre-Specific Considerations

### For Blue-Collar Sci-Fi Noir
- **Sensory Focus**: Industrial textures, mechanical sounds, recycled air
- **Reaction Style**: Understated, practical, wary
- **Sentence Efficiency**: Lean prose with selective detail bursts
- **World Consistency**: Avoid Earth-specific references unless characters have that connection

### For Archaeological Thriller
- **Sensory Focus**: Ancient vs. modern contrasts, discovery moments
- **Reaction Style**: Professional curiosity, mounting dread
- **Sentence Efficiency**: Technical precision balanced with wonder
- **World Consistency**: Use your universe's history and tech levels

### World-Building Integration
When enhancing prose, ensure all details fit your established universe:
- Replace Earth-centric references with world-appropriate alternatives
- Use system/planet names from your universe
- Reference appropriate technology levels
- Maintain consistent historical references (pre-Collapse, corporate systems, etc.)
- Keep food/material references consistent with available resources

## Tracking and Metrics

### Quantitative Measures
- Senses engaged per scene (target: 3+)
- Reaction beats per 1000 words (target: 8-12)
- Multi-function sentence ratio (target: 70%+)

### Qualitative Indicators
- Reader immersion depth
- Character memorability
- Scene vividness
- Emotional resonance

- Complements [[character-voice-guide]] for dialogue consistency
- Supports [[theme-framework]] through loaded details
- Works with [[validation]] for quality assurance

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Pitfall: Sensory Overload
**Solution**: Prioritize senses that advance the story moment

### Pitfall: Reaction Loops
**Solution**: Vary reaction types and intensities

### Pitfall: Purple Prose
**Solution**: Every enhancement must serve the story

### Pitfall: Voice Inconsistency
**Solution**: Filter enhancements through character POV

## Practice Exercises

### Exercise 1: Sensory Layering
Take a basic action sentence and add two relevant sensory details that also reveal character state.

### Exercise 2: Reaction Building
Write the same event from three character POVs, showing different reaction chains.

### Exercise 3: Sentence Fusion
Combine three single-function sentences into one multi-function sentence.
