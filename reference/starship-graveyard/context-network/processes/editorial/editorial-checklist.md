- [ ] Setting details echo theme

## Post-Edit Assessment

### Quantitative Improvements
- Senses per scene: Before ___ / After ___
- Reaction beats: Before ___ / After ___
- Multi-function ratio: Before ___% / After ___%

### Qualitative Improvements
- [ ] Scene more immersive
- [ ] Characters feel more present
- [ ] Emotions land with more impact
- [ ] World feels more tangible

### Reader Experience Check
- [ ] Can reader place themselves in scene?

## Common Problem Flags

### Over-Enhancement Warning Signs

- [ ] Pacing significantly slowed
- [ ] Voice becoming inconsistent
- [ ] Sensory overload occurring

### Under-Enhancement Warning Signs
- [ ] Scenes feel flat/distant
- [ ] Characters seem robotic
- [ ] Events happen in vacuum
- [ ] Reader struggles to visualize

## Scene Type Variations

### Action Scenes
- Prioritize: Kinesthetic senses, physical reactions
- Minimize: Internal monologue, complex sentences
- Maintain: Clarity, momentum

### Discovery Scenes
- Prioritize: Visual details, cognitive reactions
- Enhance: Wonder/dread buildup, sensory contrast
- Track: Professional expertise filtering

### Emotional Scenes
- Prioritize: Internal sensations, micro-expressions
- Layer: Subtext, indirect reactions
- Build: Cumulative emotional weight

### Transition Scenes
- Prioritize: Atmospheric senses, theme echoes
- Establish: New setting, time passage
- Connect: Previous scene effects
