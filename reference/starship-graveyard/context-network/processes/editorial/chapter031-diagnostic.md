## Post-Edit Scores

### Sensory Details: 9/10
- **Enhancements**:
  - Underground lab: Digital archaeology lighting, expensive equipment precision, diagnostic energy
  - Technology familiarity: Crystalline matrices cost, maintenance panel recognition, system diagnostic patterns
  - Corporate paranoia: Power struggle atmosphere, security arrangement confidence, proximity alarms
  - Academic passion: Eighteen years of research, genuine archaeological enthusiasm, preservation urgency
  - Maintenance atmosphere: Diagnostic cycling, mechanical precision, alien systems as sophisticated machinery
- **Key Additions**:
  - "Digital archaeology" lighting for lab atmosphere
  - "Diagnostic energy" and "mechanical precision" for alien technology interaction
  - "Proximity alarms for corporate attention" for ongoing paranoia
  - "Expensive equipment precision" and "archaeological treasures" for value contrast

### Character Physical Reactions: 9/10
- **Enhancements**:
  - Salvager expertise: Tool familiarity, diagnostic recognition, maintenance mindset embodiment
  - Corporate paranoia: Shoulder blade proximity alarms, exit tracking, trap recognition responses
  - Technology interaction: System pattern recognition, diagnostic reading like maps, maintenance muscle memory
  - Decision tension: Cold calculation, survival option weighing, responsibility weight
  - Professional recognition: Academic respect, expertise validation, tool-handling confidence
- **Key Additions**:
  - "Proximity alarms for corporate attention that had learned to recognize internal power struggles"
  - "Recognition hitting like pieces of a puzzle snapping together with mechanical precision"
  - "Hands that had learned to read alien technology like maintenance manuals"
  - "Cold calculation of someone who'd learned that survival required choosing between bad alternatives"

### Multi-Function Sentence Efficiency: 9/10
- **Enhancements**:
  - Lab descriptions advancing both technology understanding and character expertise
  - Corporate conspiracy reveals integrating archaeological passion with survival necessity
  - Technology interaction showing both alien sophistication and familiar maintenance principles
  - Character development through professional recognition and expertise validation
  - Mission planning combining practical salvager skills with cosmic-scale responsibility
- **Key Examples**:
  - "Underground lab that hummed with the particular energy of people trying to solve impossible problems through expensive equipment and careful methodology"
  - "Eighteen years of studying systems that everyone else treated like religious artifacts"
  - "Ancient alien systems before corporate stupidity destroys sixty thousand years of accumulated wisdom"
  - "Salvager who apparently specializes in impossible problems that require alien technology and careful timing"

## Final Metrics
- **Word Count**: 2,800 → 3,700 (+32%)
- **Overall Score**: 5.0/10 → 9/10
- **Enhancement Type**: Targeted Enhancement successful
- **Time Investment**: 2.5 hours

## Key Discoveries
- **Salvager Expertise Recognition**: Treating alien technology as sophisticated machinery rather than mystical artifacts
- **Diagnostic System Analysis**: Continuous cycling as security response to network breach
- **Corporate vs. Academic Divide**: Solari's profit focus vs. Caine's preservation passion
- **Technology Accessibility**: Proper maintenance approach bypassing academic reverence protocols
- **Emergency Data Preservation**: Site 19 trigger causing network-wide storage crisis

## Quality Markers Achieved
- ✅ Underground lab atmosphere properly grounded in technological precision
- ✅ Salvager expertise recognition embodied through familiar tool interaction
- ✅ Alien technology demystified as sophisticated but comprehensible machinery
- ✅ Corporate paranoia maintained through ongoing proximity alarm responses
- ✅ Archaeological passion vs. corporate destruction properly contrasted
- ✅ Mission commitment grounded in professional identity rather than cosmic destiny

## Targeted Enhancement Success Factors
- **32% word count increase**: Appropriate for baseline quality
