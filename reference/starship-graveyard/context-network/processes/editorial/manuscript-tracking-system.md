- **Abstraction**: Concrete
- **Confidence**: High

## Overview

Systematic tracking approach for applying the three-layer editorial framework across 38 chapters of the Starship Graveyard manuscript. Designed for sustainable progress and consistent quality.

## Manuscript Overview

- **Total Chapters**: 38 (chapter026 appears to be missing)
- **Estimated Words**: ~150,000-200,000 (based on typical chapter lengths)
- **Current Status**: Chapters 1-2 partially enhanced

## Work Session Structure

### Recommended Session Size
- **2-3 chapters per session** (approximately 10,000-15,000 words)
- **Time estimate**: 3-4 hours per session
- **Break between sessions**: Minimum 30 minutes to maintain fresh perspective

### Chapter Processing Workflow

1. **Pre-Edit Assessment** (15 minutes)
   - Read full chapter
   - Diagnostic scoring (sensory/reaction/efficiency)
   - Identify priority sections

2. **Three-Pass Enhancement** (90-120 minutes)
   - Pass 1: Sensory enrichment
   - Pass 2: Character reactions
   - Pass 3: Sentence efficiency
   - Maintain continuous saves with version control

3. **Post-Edit Review** (15 minutes)
   - Metrics tracking
   - Voice consistency check
   - Note any discovered patterns

4. **Integration Check** (10 minutes)
   - Continuity with previous chapters
   - Update tracking sheet
   - Flag any issues for follow-up

## Batch Organization

### Phase 1: Foundation (Chapters 1-10)
**Focus**: Establish enhanced voice, identify recurring patterns
- Batch 1: Chapters 1-3 (Opening establishment)
- Batch 2: Chapters 4-6 (Character introductions)
- Batch 3: Chapters 7-10 (World expansion)

### Phase 2: Development (Chapters 11-20)
**Focus**: Maintain consistency, refine techniques
- Batch 4: Chapters 11-13
- Batch 5: Chapters 14-16
- Batch 6: Chapters 17-20

### Phase 3: Escalation (Chapters 21-30)
**Focus**: Intensity increase, tension building
- Batch 7: Chapters 21-23
- Batch 8: Chapters 24-26 (note: 26 missing)
- Batch 9: Chapters 27-30

### Phase 4: Resolution (Chapters 31-38)
**Focus**: Payoff delivery, thematic reinforcement
- Batch 10: Chapters 31-33
- Batch 11: Chapters 34-36
- Batch 12: Chapters 37-38 (Finale)

## Efficiency Optimizations

### Reusable Elements

1. **Character Reaction Templates**
   - Marcus: Physical drumming, ADHD patterns
   - Rhea: Speaker quality shifts, data processing
   - Others: Build as introduced

2. **Sensory Palettes**
   - Salvage yard: Rust, ozone, metal, heat
   - Port: Fuel, crowds, announcements, vibration
   - Ship interiors: Recycled air, electronics, confined

3. **Sentence Patterns**
   - Action + sensation + emotion
   - Description + history + character
   - Dialogue + gesture + subtext

### Batch Preparation

Before each session:
1. Review previous chapter endings
2. Check character appearance schedule
3. Note any setup/payoff threads
4. Refresh genre tone requirements

### Common Issues Checklist

- [ ] Earth-specific references removed
- [ ] Tech consistency maintained
- [ ] Character voice preserved
- [ ] Pacing not slowed by enhancements
- [ ] Multi-function ratio achieved

## Time and Progress Estimates

### Per Chapter
- **Reading/Assessment**: 15 minutes
- **Enhancement**: 60-90 minutes
- **Review/Integration**: 15 minutes
- **Total**: 90-120 minutes per chapter

### Full Manuscript
- **38 chapters Ã— 1.75 hours average**: 66.5 hours
- **12 batch sessions**: ~5.5 hours each
- **Recommended timeline**: 4-6 weeks at 3 sessions/week

### Efficiency Gains
- **Chapters 1-5**: 2 hours each (learning curve)
- **Chapters 6-20**: 1.75 hours each (rhythm established)
- **Chapters 21-38**: 1.5 hours each (patterns internalized)

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative
- Sensory details: 3+ per scene minimum
- Multi-function sentences: 70%+ ratio
- Reaction beats: 8-12 per 1000 words

### Qualitative
- Immersion depth increased
- Character presence strengthened
- World texture enriched
- Reader engagement improved

## Integration with Context Network

### Update Requirements
- After each batch: Update editorial progress log
- Pattern discoveries: Add to framework guides
- Character insights: Update voice guides
- World details: Note in setting documents

### Review Cycles
- Every 10 chapters: Full consistency review
- Every phase: Pattern consolidation
- Final pass: Complete integration check

## Contingency Planning

### If Behind Schedule
- Reduce batch size to 2 chapters
- Focus on high-impact scenes only
- Prioritize dialogue sections

### If Quality Drops
- Take longer break
- Review framework guides
- Work single chapter only
- Consider time of day adjustment

### If Continuity Issues
- Stop forward progress
- Document all issues
- Fix before proceeding
- Update tracking notes
