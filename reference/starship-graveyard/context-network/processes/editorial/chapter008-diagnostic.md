- Dr. Voss's institutional pressure building

**Weaknesses:**
- Physical manifestations of stress underplayed
- Team dynamics need body language
- Morgue's evil too abstract, needs physicality
- Death scenes lack visceral impact
- Character interactions missing physical cues

### Prose Efficiency: 4/10
**Strengths:**
- Clear theme of institutional violence
- Good structural concept

**Weaknesses:**
- Heavy exposition and dialogue
- Telling instead of showing emotions
- Single-function sentences dominate
- Corporate speak needs grounding
- Missing multi-layered descriptions

## Scene-by-Scene Analysis

### Scene 1: Cataloging the Evidence (Lines 3-84)
- **Hook**: Good concept but needs sensory grounding
- **Issues**: Cargo hold atmosphere missing, team stress underplayed
- **Opportunities**: Physical manifestations of loss, evidence weight

### Scene 2: Site Assessment Committee (Lines 85-158)
- **Hook**: Corporate evil concept strong
- **Issues**: Meeting room generic, evil too abstract
- **Opportunities**: Banality of evil through physical details

### Scene 3: Institutional Pressure (Lines 159-197)
- **Hook**: Death by institutional pressure powerful
- **Issues**: Voss's death needs more physical build-up
- **Opportunities**: Stress accumulation in body

### Scene 4: Underground Networks (Lines 198-267)
- **Hook**: Desperation and fracturing team
- **Issues**: Safe house setting vague, emotions not embodied
- **Opportunities**: Physical environment reflecting psychological state

## Priority Enhancement Areas

1. **Cargo Hold Atmosphere**: Cramped, recycled air, evidence weight
2. **Physical Stress Markers**: Bodies showing strain, exhaustion
3. **Corporate Evil Physicality**: Morgue's presence, meeting room luxury
4. **Death by Stress**: Dr. Voss's body breaking down
5. **Safe House Desperation**: Industrial decay reflecting team state

## Efficiency Patterns to Implement

### From Previous Chapters:
- Environmental reflection of emotion
- Multi-function sentences
- Physical reactions to revelations
- Character-specific nervous habits

### New Opportunities:
- Institutional violence as slow physical destruction
- Corporate banality hiding evil
- Evidence as literal weight
- Desperation in confined spaces

## Character Voice Consistency Check

### Marcus Patterns to Maintain:
- Finger drumming ✗ (missing)
- Salvager instincts ✓ (some financial pattern recognition)
- Physical response to stress ✗ (needs enhancement)

### Team Dynamics:
- Dr. Sandoval's academic breaking point
- Oriz's career loss physicality
- Kit's investigator confidence cracking
- Trizik's alien perspective on human corruption

### Catherine Morgue:
- Needs physical presence established
- Corporate evil through mundane actions
- Contrasts with her polished appearance

## Specific Fix List

1. Lines 3-6: Enhance cargo hold sensory environment
2. Lines 7-9: Physical manifestations of team losses
3. Lines 87-90: Corporate meeting room luxury details
4. Lines 110-115: Morgue's physical presence and mannerisms
5. Lines 180-190: Dr. Voss's stress accumulating in body
6. Lines 185-192: Heart attack physical build-up and impact
7. Lines 199-205: Safe house industrial decay atmosphere
8. Lines 220-230: Team fracturing through body language
9. Lines 240-250: Countdown pressure physicalized
10. Lines 260-267: Final desperation in physical space

## Success Metrics
- Target sensory moments: 35-40 (currently ~10)
- Target reaction beats: 30-35 (currently ~15)
- Target multi-function sentences: 45+ (currently ~8)
- Expected word count increase: 20-25% (to ~3,900-4,000)

## Key Opportunities

### Institutional Violence Theme
- Show through bodies breaking down
- Stress accumulating in physical ways
- Corporate spaces as weapons

### Evidence as Weight
- Physical burden of proof
- Team carrying literal/figurative load
- Truth as exhausting weight

### Countdown Desperation
- Time pressure in heartbeats
- Space closing in
- Bodies showing strain
