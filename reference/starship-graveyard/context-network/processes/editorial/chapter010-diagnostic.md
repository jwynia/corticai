## Scene-Specific Issues

- No sensory details of the industrial district
- Infiltration lacks tactile/auditory elements
- Workshop discovery needs artifact sensory details

### Scene 2: Unexpected Confrontation
- Public confrontation lacks crowd energy sensory details
- Missing Marcus's physical stress responses
- No environmental atmosphere (Port Central administrative complex)
- Commissioner Vale interaction needs more physical tension

### Scene 3: Public Revelation
- Detention facility needs sensory atmosphere
- Missing physical discomfort/adaptation to custody
- Meeting room lacks environmental details
- No accumulation of exhaustion

### Scene 4: New Alliance
- Conference room sterile, needs sensory anchors
- Missing Marcus's physical transformation markers
- No sensory contrast between old life and new
- Final realization needs physical grounding

## Enhancement Opportunities

### Sensory Palette
- **Industrial district**: Oil, metal, exhaust, machinery hum
- **Facility interior**: Climate control hum, artifact dust, chemical preservation smells
- **Port Central**: Crowd noise, administrative building smell, public space echoes
- **Detention center**: Disinfectant, confined air, metal and concrete
- **Alliance headquarters**: Old building smell, professional atmosphere, technology hum

### Character Physical Markers
- **Marcus without Rhea**: Reaching for absent voice, empty passenger seat, silence weight
- **Infiltration stress**: Sweating, heartbeat, careful breathing
- **Public confrontation**: Voice control, stance shifts, crowd awareness
- **Transformation**: Posture changes, exhaustion vs. determination

### Multi-Function Sentence Targets
- Combine action with emotional state
- Load dialogue tags with physical information
- Merge environmental and character details
- Connect past comfort with present purpose

## Priority Enhancements

1. **Opening**: Establish Marcus's physical/sensory experience of Rhea's absence
2. **Infiltration**: Add tactile lockpicking, facility atmosphere, artifact details
3. **Public scene**: Crowd energy, recording device weight, security pressure
4. **Detention**: Physical reality of custody, institutional sensory markers
5. **Transformation**: Sensory markers of old life lost, new purpose gained

## Quantitative Targets
- Add 30-40 sensory details across chapter
- Include 25-30 character physical reactions
- Convert 40-50 single-function sentences to multi-function
- Maintain pacing while adding depth
- Keep additional word count under 25% increase
