- Staging area transformation needs sensory markers
- Missing physical details of teams preparing
- Revelation about site pattern lacks visceral impact
- No exhaustion accumulation despite pressure

### Scene 3: Racing Against Acceleration
- Planning urgency needs physical grounding
- Missing sensory details of equipment prep
- Team dynamics need body language
- Countdown pressure not felt physically

### Scene 4: Point of No Return
- Tactical gear needs more sensory detail
- Missing pre-mission physical tension
- Transport approach lacks visceral buildup
- Breach moment needs explosive sensory impact

## Enhancement Opportunities

### Sensory Palette
- **War room under pressure**: Stale coffee, body odor, overheated electronics
- **Staging area**: Weapon oil, medical antiseptic, nervous energy
- **Tactical gear**: Unfamiliar weight, restricted movement, synthetic materials
- **Facility approach**: Engine vibration, team breathing, adrenaline taste
- **Breach**: Explosive sounds, glass, smoke, chaos

### Character Physical Markers
- **Time pressure**: Shortened breaths, tense shoulders, quick movements
- **Team dynamics**: Synchronized movements, shared glances, physical proximity

### Multi-Function Sentence Targets
- Combine countdown with physical sensation

- Connect preparation with emotional weight
- Load action verbs with urgency

## Priority Enhancements

1. **Countdown physicality**: Make time pressure felt in bodies
2. **Team assembly**: Distinct sensory signatures for each group
3. **Revelation impact**: Physical responses to site destruction pattern
4. **Gear transformation**: Marcus in tactical vs. salvage equipment
5. **Breach sequence**: Full sensory assault of combat entry

## Quantitative Targets
- Add 35-40 sensory details across chapter
- Include 25-30 character physical reactions
- Convert 40-45 single-function sentences to multi-function
- Maintain thriller pacing while adding depth
- Keep additional word count under 25% increase
