  - Patient interactions: Bird-bone fingers, face twitching, dragging limbs
  - Discovery moment: Stim crash trembling, data-stream blue painting faces
  - Trap realization: Phone cracking on name, digital silence, decompression metaphor
- **Key Additions**:
  - "Marcus rubbed eyes that felt like someone had poured sand and regret behind the lids"

- **Enhancement Type**: Intensive Care successful
- **Time Investment**: 2.5 hours

## Key Discoveries
- **Warehouse Refuge**: Needs industrial decay mixed with desperate humanity
- **Patient Testimonies**: Physical deterioration must parallel story importance
