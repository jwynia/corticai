# Anachronism Tracking Document

## Classification
- **Domain**: Editorial
- **Stability**: Dynamic
- **Abstraction**: Concrete
- **Confidence**: High

## Purpose
Track anachronistic references that need correction after the primary editorial enhancement pass. These are Earth-specific or contemporary references that don't fit the established sci-fi setting.

## Established World Technology
- Grav-plates and gravity manipulation
- AR projections and holo displays
- Quantum processors
- AI systems with full sentience
- Space travel (FTL implied)
- Energy weapons
- Electronic warfare capabilities
- Recycled air systems
- Industrial space stations

## Anachronisms Identified

### Chapter 1
- âœ“ "Wisconsin cheese" - Already caught and noted in previous session
- Any other Earth-specific food references

### Chapter 2
- Check for Earth-specific references during Crux encounter

### Chapter 3
- Review for contemporary technology references

### Chapter 4
- Review corporate office descriptions for anachronisms

### Chapter 5
**Lines 7-8**: "asphalt still slick with morning condensation" / "tires squealing against asphalt"
- Should be: hover/grav vehicle on transit ways or landing pads
- Energy fields instead of tires
- Repulsor systems instead of wheels

**Line 7**: "worn vinyl seats"
- Should be: energy cushion seats, smart fabric, or other futuristic material

**Line 153**: "industrial district where the buildings were large enough to hide entire ships"
- This works if ships can land in cities, but verify consistency with world-building

## Correction Guidelines

### Vehicle Technology
- Replace wheels/tires with repulsor/grav systems
- Replace roads/asphalt with transit ways/landing grids
- Replace vinyl/leather with smart materials/energy cushions
- Add inertial dampeners for high-speed maneuvers

### Food/Beverage
- Replace Earth-specific foods with generic or invented alternatives
- Maintain "coffee" as established luxury item (seems universal)
- Create consistent naming for synthetic/processed foods

### Materials
- Replace contemporary materials (vinyl, leather) with futuristic alternatives
- Maintain industrial metals (seems appropriate for salvage setting)
- Energy fields and force barriers where appropriate

### Geography
- Remove Earth-specific location references
- Replace with generic descriptions or invented place names
- Maintain "sectors" and "systems" terminology

## Next Steps
1. Complete primary editorial enhancement pass (Chapters 6-39)
2. Perform dedicated anachronism review pass
3. Ensure consistency across all chapters
4. Update world-building documentation with established terms
