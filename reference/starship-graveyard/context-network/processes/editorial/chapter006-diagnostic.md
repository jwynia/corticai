# Chapter 6 Diagnostic Assessment

## Classification
- **Domain**: Editorial
- **Stability**: Dynamic
- **Abstraction**: Concrete
- **Confidence**: High

## Chapter Profile
- **Title**: Chapter 6
- **POV**: Marcus Patel
- **Current Word Count**: ~3,700
- **Scenes**: 4

## Initial Scoring (1-10 scale)

### Sensory Details: 4/10
**Strengths:**
- Some good tactile descriptions (bulkheads, electromagnetic shielding)
- Visual of Scatter Belt debris field
- Mention of stomach settling with gravity

**Weaknesses:**
- Ship interior lacks atmospheric details (sounds, smells, temperature)
- Training scene needs physical sensations of equipment
- Scatter Belt passage missing electromagnetic effects on senses
- Approach to site lacks awe-inducing sensory details
- Missing opportunity for claustrophobic ship atmosphere

### Character Reactions: 5/10
**Strengths:**
- Marcus's anxiety during Rhea's transfer
- Some tension during navigation crisis
- Brief character conflict moments

**Weaknesses:**
- Physical stress reactions during crisis underplayed
- Missing body language during training
- Detective Oriz's first space travel needs more physical response
- Team dynamics lack physical interaction details
- Emotional beats need bodily manifestation

### Prose Efficiency: 4/10
**Strengths:**
- Clear scene transitions
- Some effective dialogue

**Weaknesses:**
- Heavy exposition without sensory integration
- Many single-function sentences
- Telling instead of showing emotional states
- Repetitive dialogue patterns
- Missing opportunities for multi-layered descriptions

## Scene-by-Scene Analysis

### Scene 1: Into the Unknown (Lines 3-54)
- **Hook**: Good concept but needs sensory punch
- **Issues**: Ship description too technical, lacks atmosphere
- **Opportunities**: Military ship should feel different - cramped, scarred, haunted

### Scene 2: Learning Site Authentication (Lines 55-123)
- **Hook**: Training sequence functional but dry
- **Issues**: Equipment interaction needs physical details
- **Opportunities**: Authentication as visceral feeling, not just visual

### Scene 3: Through the Scatter Belt (Lines 124-230)
- **Hook**: Navigation crisis has potential but underdelivered
- **Issues**: Electromagnetic effects not felt, crisis lacks urgency
- **Opportunities**: War graveyard atmosphere, system corruption tension

### Scene 4: Approaching Kepler-442c Site 7 (Lines 231-307)
- **Hook**: Site reveal needs more wonder
- **Issues**: Missing awe and dread of approaching intact site
- **Opportunities**: Contrast between beauty and imminent destruction

## Priority Enhancement Areas

1. **Military Ship Atmosphere**: Scars, cramped spaces, war memories in metal
2. **Physical Training**: Weight of equipment, muscle memory, tactile authentication
3. **Scatter Belt Passage**: Electromagnetic tingles, gravity fluctuations, debris threats
4. **Navigation Crisis**: Sweat, trembling hands, held breath during repairs
5. **Site Approach**: Wonder mixing with dread, scale overwhelming senses

## Efficiency Patterns to Implement

### From Previous Chapters:
- Environmental details as emotional reflection
- Multi-function sentences (action + sensation + insight)
- Physical manifestations of stress/fear
- Character-specific nervous habits

### New Opportunities:
- Space travel physical effects
- Military surplus atmosphere (different from civilian)
- Authentication as full-body experience
- Electromagnetic phenomena sensations

## Character Voice Consistency Check

### Marcus Patterns to Maintain:
- Finger drumming ✗ (missing)
- Salvager's assessment eye ✓ (some instances)
- Sarcastic defense ✓ (present in crisis)
- Physical comfort with equipment ✗ (needs enhancement)

### Team Dynamics to Develop:
- Dr. Sandoval's exhaustion/grief
- Detective Oriz's out-of-element reactions
- Rhea's integration struggles
- Group tension under pressure

## Specific Fix List

1. Lines 5-8: Add sensory details of military ship (scars, smells, sounds)
2. Lines 11-15: Make Rhea's transfer more visceral
3. Lines 26-28: Oriz's first space travel needs physical response
4. Lines 59-65: Equipment training needs tactile details
5. Lines 127-135: Scatter Belt passage needs electromagnetic sensations
6. Lines 145-175: Navigation crisis needs sweating, trembling, held breath
7. Lines 235-245: Site reveal needs awe-inspiring sensory cascade
8. Lines 155-175: Character conflict needs physical manifestations
9. Lines 265-275: Approach tension needs bodily stress markers
10. Lines 290-305: Final approach needs building dread

## Success Metrics
- Target sensory moments: 40-45 (currently ~15)
- Target reaction beats: 30-35 (currently ~18)
- Target multi-function sentences: 50+ (currently ~10)
- Expected word count increase: 20-25% (to ~4,500-4,700)

## Key Opportunities

### Military Ship as Character
- Battle scars telling stories
- Paranoid over-engineering details
- Haunted by electronic warfare damage

### Authentication as Sensory Experience
- Fingers knowing truth through touch
- Gut feeling about authenticity
- Physical response to fakes vs. real

### Scatter Belt as Graveyard
- Debris like floating tombstones
- Electromagnetic storms as ghosts
- Navigation through history's wreckage
