## Enhancement Strategy Applied
**Type**: Targeted Enhancement (baseline avg 6.3/10)
**Approach**: Focus on lockdown atmosphere, cooperation physicalization, and collapse visceral details
**Target Increase**: 15-20% word count

## Post-Edit Scores

### Sensory Details: 9/10
- **Enhancements**:
  - Lockdown atmosphere: Mechanical finality, cordite and fear, ancient engineering patience
  - Cooperation scenes: Awkward movements, shared burdens, corporate armor breaking
  - Building collapse: Death throes, concrete dominoes, dying beast groans
  - Evacuation chaos: Emergency lighting through smoke, architectural agony, salvation urgency
- **Key Additions**:
  - "Blast doors slammed shut with mechanical finality, the sound reverberating through the archive"
  - "Breathing the same recycled air thick with cordite and fear"
  - "Building groaned around them like a dying beast, supports failing one by one"
  - "Site 12 collapsed behind them in a symphony of concrete and twisted metal"

### Character Physical Reactions: 9/10
- **Enhancements**:
  - Forced cooperation: Wary predators, tentative movements gaining purpose
  - Trust building: Manicured hands gentle on patients, corporate shoulders bearing weight
  - Collapse stress: Blood dripping from wounds, joints protesting, exhaustion hollowing voices
  - Hostage shock: Phone against ribs, freezing mid-step, mechanical cruelty loops
- **Key Additions**:

- **Overall Score**: 6.3/10 → 9/10
- **Enhancement Type**: Targeted Enhancement successful
- **Time Investment**: 2 hours

## Key Discoveries
- **Lockdown Sequences**: Ancient system activation needs weight of ages and algorithmic patience
- **Forced Cooperation**: Physical awkwardness of enemies working together requires detailed choreography
- **Building Collapse**: Structural failure needs both grand scale and intimate danger
- **Network Self-Healing**: Digital resurrection metaphors effective for technology themes
- **Hostage Pressure**: Corporate exploitation of personal connections needs visceral impact

## Quality Markers Achieved
