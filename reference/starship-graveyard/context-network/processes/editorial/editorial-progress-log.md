**Priority Tasks**:
1. Apply adaptive framework to Chapter 18
2. Continue corporate conspiracy escalation
3. Build tension toward climax
4. Maintain established character patterns

## Quality Assurance Notes

### Consistency Checks Needed
- [ ] Coffee/food as luxury markers
- [ ] Port geography (eastern edge, 30km to salvage yard)
- [ ] Tech level (grav-plates, AR projections)
- [ ] Character backstory hints (criminal record, 5 years at yard)

### Continuity Tracking
- Marcus successfully retrieved Serval (Chapter 2 complete)
- Serval in worse condition than expected (mystery deepens)
- Port contract opportunity established
- Three-week deadline running
- Emil Reeves connection established
- Crux encounter sets precedent for alien interactions

## Efficiency Analysis

### What's Working
- Three-pass system maintains focus
- Character templates speed consistency
- Sensory palettes prevent repetition
- Multi-function examples guide construction

### Areas for Improvement
- Need quicker Earth-reference detection
- Character-specific gesture library
- Faster sentence combination techniques
- Batch prep could be streamlined

## Emerging Patterns & Insights

### Chapter 2 Pattern Confirmations
- Multi-function sentences now feel natural and integrated
- Physical comedy can coexist with serious tone (toolbox drop)
- Alien perspectives require unique sensory vocabulary
- Environmental sounds as emotional backdrop highly effective

### Time Investment Analysis
- Chapter 1: 1.5 hours (learning curve included)
- Chapter 2: 2 hours (smoother process)
- Projected average: 1.5-2 hours per chapter
- Total estimated time: 57-76 hours for full manuscript

## Pattern Library (Growing)

### Sentence Starters That Work
- "[Character] found themselves..." (internal state)
- "The [object/place] [unexpected verb]..." (active description)
- "[Sense] hit like..." (immediate sensory)
- "Something in [their/his/her] [body part]..." (physical reaction)

### Transition Techniques
- Sensory shifts for scene breaks
- Physical movement between topics
- Sound bridges (fading/approaching)
- Temperature/light changes

### Subtext Carriers
- Speaker quality (Rhea)
- Coffee quality (economy markers)
- Furniture condition (class indicators)
- Repair states (care/neglect themes)
