# Pre-Change Analysis Protocol

## Purpose
Systematic approach to analyzing potential revisions before implementation to predict consequences and prevent narrative damage.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Process
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Abstraction:** Procedural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Change Level

Determine which level(s) the revision primarily affects:

#### Conceptual Level Changes
- Altering character motivations or core traits
- Shifting thematic focus or meaning
- Changing fundamental story questions
- Modifying character growth arcs

#### Structural Level Changes
- Reordering scenes or chapters
- Adding or removing plot beats
- Adjusting pacing or tension curves
- Changing POV structure

#### Manuscript Level Changes
- Revising dialogue or narrative voice
- Improving descriptions
- Fixing prose issues
- Adjusting tone or style

### Step 2: Map Forward Consequences

For each proposed change, explicitly document:

#### Immediate Effects (Next 1-2 Chapters)
- Which scenes directly reference the changed element?
- What dialogue or actions must be updated?
- Which character reactions need adjustment?
- What plot mechanics are affected?

**Example Format:**
```markdown
## Immediate Effects - Chapters [X-Y]
- Chapter X, Scene 2: Maya's dialogue about [element] needs updating
- Chapter Y, Scene 1: Marcus's reaction assumes old version
- Chapter Y, Scene 3: Plot point depends on [old element]
```

#### Medium-term Effects (Next 3-5 Chapters)
- How does this change affect upcoming plot developments?
- Which character relationships evolve differently?
- What foreshadowing needs adjustment?
- Which themes require reinforcement?

**Example Format:**
```markdown
## Medium-term Effects - Chapters [X-Z]
- Chapter X: Trust dynamics shift earlier than planned
- Chapter Y: Revelation scene needs new setup
- Chapter Z: Climactic moment requires different buildup
```

#### Story-wide Effects
- Does this affect the ending?
- Are major plot points undermined?
- Do character arcs still complete satisfactorily?
- Is thematic coherence maintained?

**Example Format:**
```markdown
## Story-wide Effects
- Ending: Still works but emphasis shifts from X to Y
- Character Arc: Maya's growth accelerates, affecting Act 3
- Theme: Archaeological discovery metaphor needs reinforcement
```

### Step 3: Create Monitoring Criteria

Define specific warning signs that indicate problems:

#### Character Behavior Warnings
- [ ] Character acts against established personality
- [ ] Dialogue doesn't match character voice
- [ ] Knowledge appears that character shouldn't have
- [ ] Motivation becomes unclear or contradictory

#### Plot Logic Warnings
- [ ] Events don't follow from causes
- [ ] Timeline becomes impossible
- [ ] Information has no source
- [ ] Stakes become meaningless

#### Pacing Warnings
- [ ] Scenes feel rushed
- [ ] Tension dissipates unexpectedly
- [ ] Reader engagement likely drops
- [ ] Rhythm becomes monotonous

#### Thematic Warnings
- [ ] Theme becomes heavy-handed
- [ ] Symbolism breaks down
- [ ] Message contradicts story events
- [ ] Meaning becomes unclear

### Step 4: Define Success Indicators

What tells you the revision is working?

- [ ] Character behavior feels more authentic
- [ ] Plot flows more naturally
- [ ] Pacing improves reader engagement
- [ ] Themes emerge more organically
- [ ] Prose better serves the story

### Step 5: Set Rollback Triggers

Establish clear criteria for abandoning the change:

#### Hard Stops (Immediate Rollback)
- Fundamental character logic breaks
- Plot becomes incomprehensible
- Multiple cascade failures within 2 chapters
- Core story purpose undermined

#### Warning Zones (Evaluate Carefully)
- 3+ monitoring warnings triggered
- Cascade tasks exceed 10 items
- Character voice noticeably shifts
- Reader confusion likely

## Analysis Template

```markdown
# Revision Analysis: [Brief Description]

## Change Classification
- **Primary Level**: [Conceptual/Structural/Manuscript]
- **Secondary Effects**: [Other affected levels]
- **Scope**: [Local/Chapter/Section/Story-wide]

## Current State Snapshot
[Document what exists before the change]

## Proposed Change
[Exactly what will be modified]

## Consequence Mapping

### Immediate (Chapters X-Y)
- [Specific effect 1]
- [Specific effect 2]

### Medium-term (Chapters X-Z)
- [Specific effect 1]
- [Specific effect 2]

### Story-wide
- [Major impact 1]
- [Major impact 2]

## Monitoring Criteria
### Warning Signs
- [ ] [Specific warning 1]
- [ ] [Specific warning 2]

### Success Indicators
- [ ] [Success metric 1]
- [ ] [Success metric 2]

## Rollback Triggers
### Hard Stops
- [Condition 1]
- [Condition 2]

### Warning Zones
- [Condition 1]
- [Condition 2]

## Risk Assessment
- **Probability of Success**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Cascade Complexity**: [Simple/Moderate/Complex]
- **Rollback Difficulty**: [Easy/Moderate/Difficult]

## Recommendation
[Proceed/Proceed with caution/Reconsider approach/Do not proceed]
```

## Integration with Revision Process

This analysis feeds into:
1. [Implementation Workflow](revision-implementation.md) - Provides roadmap
2. [Cascade Management](revision-cascades.md) - Identifies ripples
3. [Revision Records](revision-records.md) - Documents decision basis
4. [Monitoring Logs](revision-monitoring.md) - Sets tracking criteria

## Relationships
