# Plot Structure Revision Protocol

## Purpose
Specialized guidance for revising plot structure, pacing, and story architecture while maintaining narrative coherence and dramatic effectiveness.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Process
- **Stability:** Stable
- **Abstraction:** Procedural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Common Plot Revision Triggers

### Symptoms Requiring Revision
- Pacing feels too slow or rushed
- Events seem disconnected or arbitrary
- Climax lacks impact or satisfaction
- Middle sags or meanders
- Stakes feel low or unclear
- Cause-effect chains break down
- Reader engagement drops

### Diagnostic Questions
1. Where specifically does the story lose momentum?
2. Which plot points feel unearned or forced?
3. What promises does the opening make?
4. Does the climax deliver on those promises?
5. Are stakes clear and escalating?

## Pre-Revision Plot Audit

### Current Structure Mapping

```markdown
## Plot Structure Analysis

### Three-Act Breakdown
**Act 1 (Ch 1-X):**
- Inciting Incident: [Event] (Ch Y)
- Key Setup: [What's established]
- Central Question: [What drives story]

**Act 2A (Ch X-Y):**
- First Pinch Point: [Event] (Ch Z)
- Rising Action: [Main developments]
- Midpoint Shift: [Major turn] (Ch A)

**Act 2B (Ch Y-Z):**
- Second Pinch Point: [Event] (Ch B)
- Complications: [What goes wrong]
- Dark Night: [Lowest point] (Ch C)

**Act 3 (Ch Z-End):**
- Climax: [Final confrontation] (Ch D)
- Resolution: [How ends]

### Tension Curve
Ch 1-5: Building (establish normal)
Ch 6-10: Rising (complications begin)
Ch 11-15: Peaks and valleys (try/fail cycles)
Ch 16-20: Escalating (everything worse)
Ch 21-25: Maximum (crisis point)
Ch 26-End: Resolution

### Subplot Tracking
**Subplot A:** [Description]
- Starts: Ch X
- Intersects main: Ch Y, Z
- Resolves: Ch A

**Subplot B:** [Description]
- Starts: Ch X
- Intersects main: Ch Y, Z
- Resolves: Ch A
```

## Plot Revision Types

### Type 1: Pacing Adjustment

**When to Use:** Story drags or rushes

**Diagnosis Tools:**
```markdown
### Pacing Analysis
Ch 1: [Type of scene] - [Pace: Fast/Medium/Slow]
Ch 2: [Type of scene] - [Pace: Fast/Medium/Slow]
[Continue for all chapters]

Patterns identified:
- Too many slow scenes in succession
- No breathing room between crises
- Climax arrives too quickly/slowly
```

**Revision Strategies:**

For Slow Pacing:
1. Combine similar scenes
2. Start scenes later, end earlier
3. Add conflict to quiet moments
4. Increase scene goals
5. Cut summarizable content

For Fast Pacing:
1. Add reaction beats
2. Develop emotional consequences
3. Include character moments
4. Expand important scenes
5. Add sensory grounding

### Type 2: Causality Strengthening

**When to Use:** Events feel random or disconnected

**Process:**
1. Map cause-effect chains:
```markdown
Event A (Ch X) → causes → Event B (Ch Y) → causes → Event C (Ch Z)
                     ↘ also triggers → Subplot event (Ch Y2)
```

2. Identify broken links
3. Add missing connections
4. Strengthen weak causality
5. Remove arbitrary events

**Causality Checklist:**
- [ ] Does each event result from previous events?
- [ ] Are character decisions motivated?
- [ ] Do consequences follow logically?
- [ ] Are coincidences minimized?
- [ ] Does the ending feel inevitable?

### Type 3: Stakes Escalation

**When to Use:** Story lacks urgency or importance

**Escalation Framework:**
```markdown
### Stakes Ladder
1. **Personal:** What character might lose personally
2. **Professional:** Career/mission consequences
3. **Relational:** Impact on loved ones
4. **Communal:** Wider group affected
5. **Universal:** Largest possible impact

Current stakes stop at level: [X]
Need to reach level: [Y]
```

**Implementation:**
1. Identify current stake level
2. Brainstorm higher stakes
3. Plant seeds early
4. Escalate gradually
5. Make stakes concrete and visual

### Type 4: Structure Reordering

**When to Use:** Linear progression feels predictable

**Options:**
1. **In Media Res**: Start mid-action, backfill
2. **Frame Story**: Present/past interweaving
3. **Parallel Timelines**: Multiple POVs converging
4. **Reverse Chronology**: Effect then cause
5. **Modular**: Rearrangeable sections

**Reordering Process:**
1. List all scenes/chapters
2. Identify natural break points
3. Experiment with sequences
4. Test information revelation
5. Ensure emotional progression

### Type 5: Climax Enhancement

**When to Use:** Climax feels anticlimactic

**Enhancement Elements:**
1. **Setup**: All elements properly established
2. **Stakes**: Maximum consequences active
3. **Opposition**: Antagonist at full power
4. **Cost**: Victory requires sacrifice
5. **Surprise**: Unexpected but inevitable turn
6. **Choice**: Protagonist must decide
7. **Theme**: Core message crystallizes

**Climax Audit:**
```markdown
### Climax Analysis
- [ ] Uses all planted elements
- [ ] Protagonist drives resolution
- [ ] Stakes at maximum
- [ ] Emotional peak achieved
- [ ] Theme reinforced
- [ ] Reader satisfaction likely
```

## Implementation Strategies

### The Outline Method
1. Create detailed scene outline
2. Identify structural issues
3. Revise outline first
4. Implement changes systematically
5. Validate new structure

### The Card Method
1. Write each scene on index card
2. Include: goal, conflict, outcome
3. Physically rearrange
4. Test new sequences
5. Identify missing scenes

### The Graph Method
1. Chart tension levels
2. Map character arcs
3. Track subplot intersections
4. Identify imbalances
5. Adjust for optimal curves

## Common Cascade Effects

### When Adjusting Pacing
- Character development moments shift
- Information revelation timing changes
- Emotional beats need repositioning
- Thematic elements require redistribution

### When Strengthening Causality
- Earlier setup needs addition
- Character knowledge must adjust
- Timeline might need tweaking
- Motivations require clarification

### When Escalating Stakes
- Character reactions intensify
- Decision urgency increases
- World consequences expand
- Theme importance grows

### When Reordering Structure
- Information management crucial
- Reader orientation needs attention
- Emotional journey must still work
- Mysteries/reveals need recalibration

## Validation Specific to Plot

### Plot-Specific Checks
- [ ] Does every scene advance story?
- [ ] Are promises fulfilled?
- [ ] Do stakes continually rise?
- [ ] Is climax satisfying?
- [ ] Does structure serve story?

### Beta Reader Questions
1. Where did you get bored?
2. What felt confusing?
3. When were you most engaged?
4. Did the ending satisfy?
5. What questions remained?

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Plotting
- Too many complications
- Subplot sprawl
- Lost thematic focus
- Reader exhaustion

### Under-Plotting
- Insufficient conflict
- Low stakes
- Predictable progression
- Weak climax

### Structure Rigidity
- Following formula too closely
- Ignoring story's natural shape
- Forcing unnecessary elements
- Missing organic opportunities
