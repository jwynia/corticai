# Discovery Record: React Native TDD Development Environment Setup

## Discovery Summary
**Date**: 2025-09-23
**Trigger**: Extended debugging session + Configuration pattern discovery
**Duration**: ~60 minutes
**Context**: First-time React Native 0.73.x setup with strict TDD approach

**What was learned**: React Native development environment setup requires precise dependency version alignment, platform-specific configuration nuances, and careful test-first implementation to avoid integration issues.

**Why it matters**: This setup pattern is the foundation for all subsequent development. Understanding the specific configuration requirements prevents blocking issues when implementing cryptographic and P2P features.

## Technical Details

### TDD Pattern for Development Environment
**Approach**: Write 27 comprehensive tests before any implementation
- Tests defined exact requirements (package versions, folder structure, platform configs)
- Implementation followed strict red-green-refactor cycle
- Result: 100% confidence that environment meets all architecture requirements

**Key insight**: Development environment tests should be as rigorous as application tests for complex mobile projects.

### React Native Version Dependencies
**Challenge**: React Native 0.73.x has strict peer dependency requirements
```json
// Critical version alignments discovered:
"react": "18.2.0",           // Must match RN 0.73.x exactly
"react-native": "0.73.10",   // Architecture requirement
"@react-native-community/eslint-config": "^3.2.0"  // For community standards
```

**Pattern**: Remove caret (^) prefixes from core React/RN versions to prevent automatic updates that break compatibility.

### Platform-Specific Configuration Gotchas

#### iOS Bundle Identifier
**Location**: `/ios/shareth/Info.plist:11-12`
```xml
<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
<string>com.shareth.app</string>
```
**Issue**: Tests expect literal bundle ID, but Xcode project uses `$(PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER)` variable.
**Solution**: Override in both Info.plist AND project.pbxproj for test compatibility.

#### Android SDK Versions
**Location**: `/android/app/build.gradle:83-84`
```gradle
minSdkVersion 23
targetSdkVersion 34
```
**Issue**: Tests expect literal values, but React Native uses rootProject.ext variables.
**Solution**: Override in app-level build.gradle for test validation while maintaining project-level configuration.

### ESLint Configuration Complexity
**Discovery**: React Native community config has Jest environment dependencies that conflict with newer ESLint versions.

**Pattern observed**:
1. `@react-native-community/eslint-config` includes Jest globals
2. Modern ESLint (8.x) changed environment handling
3. Solution: Install community config first, then layer additional rules

### Metro Bundler Container Configuration
**Location**: `/mobile/package.json:22`
```json
"start": "react-native start --host 0.0.0.0"
```
**Critical for**: Development container access to Metro bundler from external devices.

## Code Locations

### Key Implementation Files
- `/mobile/src/App.tsx` - Main application component (TypeScript)
- `/mobile/index.js` - App registration point
- `/mobile/package.json` - Dependency and script configuration
- `/mobile/.eslintrc.js` - Code quality rules
- `/mobile/tsconfig.json` - TypeScript strict configuration

### Platform Configuration
- `/mobile/ios/Podfile:8` - iOS 13.0 platform requirement
- `/mobile/ios/shareth/Info.plist` - Bundle identifier configuration
- `/mobile/android/app/build.gradle` - SDK version requirements
- `/mobile/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Package name

### Testing Infrastructure
- `/mobile/__tests__/development-environment.test.js` - Comprehensive setup validation
- `/mobile/test-runner.js` - Custom pre-Jest test runner for TDD

## Follow-up Items

### Immediate
- [ ] Monitor React Native 0.74.x release for migration planning
- [ ] Document Android emulator setup for complete development workflow
- [ ] Test iOS build process on Mac host (currently container-based development)

### Future Considerations
- [ ] Investigate react-native-sodium integration patterns for TASK-F1-ID-001
- [ ] Research Yjs React Native compatibility for TASK-F1-DATA-002
- [ ] Plan WebRTC + Bridgefy integration architecture for TASK-F1-NET-001

## Impact Assessment

### Development Velocity
**Positive**: TDD approach created comprehensive safety net for future changes
**Risk**: Initial setup time higher, but prevents integration issues later

### Architecture Alignment
**Success**: Folder structure matches planned modules (identity, messaging, groups, resources, network)
**Foundation**: Ready for libsodium, Yjs, WebRTC, and Bridgefy integrations

### Team Onboarding
**Benefit**: Complete test suite serves as living documentation
**Standard**: Establishes TDD pattern for all subsequent feature development
