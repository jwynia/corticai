## Recent Updates

### TransactionManager Extraction (Phase 1 Complete) - 2025-10-01
**Category:** Architecture + Refactoring
**Status:** Completed

Successfully extracted TransactionManager from DatabaseService using Test-Driven Development, fixing memory leak and reducing service from 977 to 824 lines. First phase of planned architecture split completed with full backward compatibility.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `TransactionManager.js` (236 lines) with focused transaction handling
- Wrote 20 comprehensive tests using TDD approach
- Fixed transaction timeout memory leak with explicit cleanup
- Reduced DatabaseService by 153 lines
- Created discovery record `2025-10-01-async-detection-jest-transpilation.md`
- Created pattern document `tdd-architecture-extraction.md`
- Updated task plan with Phase 1 completion report
- Created task completion record `task-completion-008-transactionmanager-extraction.md`

**Impact:** Improved maintainability through separation of concerns, fixed memory leak, established TDD pattern for remaining extraction phases. All 76 existing tests plus 20 new tests passing.

### Index File TODO Cleanup and CommonJS Architecture Decision - 2025-09-27
**Category:** Content + Architecture
**Status:** Completed

Completed cleanup of all index file TODO comments and established formal architectural decision for CommonJS module system usage throughout the React Native codebase. This work provides a clean module foundation and consistent import/export patterns for future development.

**Changes Made:**
- Cleaned up all 5 index files (`src/utils/`, `src/types/`, `src/screens/`, `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`)
- Added proper CommonJS exports for existing utilities in `src/utils/index.ts`
- Created architectural decision record `tech-005-commonjs-module-system.md`
- Updated decision index to include TECH-005
- Created task completion record `task-completion-007-index-file-cleanup.md`
- Updated groomed backlog to reflect completed task

**Impact:** Established clean module system with documented architectural decisions. All future modules will follow CommonJS pattern for React Native ecosystem compatibility. Zero ESLint issues and 236/236 tests passing.

### LoggerService Test Fixes and Production Validation - 2025-09-26
**Category:** Content + Technical
**Status:** Completed

Completed systematic debugging and fixing of 5 critical LoggerService test failures, achieving 100% test pass rate and validating production readiness of the logging infrastructure. Applied comprehensive code review recommendations through test-driven debugging methodology.

**Changes Made:**
- Created discovery record `2025-09-26-001-loggerservice-test-fixes.md` documenting technical insights
- Updated discoveries index with new Code Quality and Debugging category
- Created task completion record `task-completion-004-loggerservice-tests.md`
- Updated groomed backlog to reflect completed LoggerService validation
- Fixed 5 critical bugs: parseLogLevel falsy values, sensitive filtering patterns, nested object logic, performance expectations, and console adapter mapping

**Impact:** LoggerService is now production-ready for codebase-wide console.* migration. Established patterns for JavaScript debugging, regex security precision, and mobile testing expectations.

### JavaScript/TypeScript Development Standards Integration - 2025-09-23
**Category:** Content + Standards
**Status:** Completed

Integrated comprehensive JavaScript/TypeScript style guide and best practices into foundation principles. Established coding standards including functional programming constraints, naming conventions, parameter design patterns, and quality guidelines for all JS/TS development.

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `foundation/principles.md` with comprehensive JS/TS development standards
- Archived original style guide document to `archive/js-and-typescript-style-guide-20250923.mdc.txt`
- Established coding standards for functional programming, naming conventions, and code organization

**Impact:** All future JavaScript/TypeScript development will follow these established standards to ensure consistent, high-quality code across the project.

### Development Environment Setup and Validation - 2025-09-23
**Category:** Content + Technical
**Status:** Completed

Comprehensive development environment validation and setup for React Native mobile app. Established discovery documentation system, created task management structure, and validated development workflow readiness for Phase 1 implementation.
