  - **Classification**: Domain: Research, Stability: Semi-stable, Abstraction: Detailed, Confidence: Established
  - **Content**: Comprehensive research on cryptographic systems, platform implementations, legal frameworks, and moderation approaches
  - **Source**: Derived from privacy-community-app-research.md

- **[elements/technical/architecture.md]**: Created new document
  - **Classification**: Domain: Technical, Stability: Semi-stable, Abstraction: Structural, Confidence: Evolving
  - **Content**: Complete technical architecture including design principles, technology stack, core modules, and security architecture
  - **Source**: Derived from privacy-community-app-tech-design.md

### Index Documents
- **[elements/index.md]**: Created new document
- **[elements/research/index.md]**: Created new document
- **[elements/technical/index.md]**: Created new document

## New Relationships Established
- [foundation/project_definition.md] → implements → [elements/technical/architecture.md]
- [foundation/branding.md] → aligns-with → [foundation/principles.md]
- [elements/research/privacy-community-platform.md] → informs → [foundation/project_definition.md]
- [elements/research/privacy-community-platform.md] → guides → [elements/technical/architecture.md]
- [foundation/branding.md] → defines → Overall project identity and values
- All index files → navigates-to → their respective content documents

## Navigation Implications
- **Foundation Path**: Users can now navigate foundation/ → project_definition.md for project overview, then branding.md for identity details
- **Research Path**: Users can navigate elements/ → research/ → privacy-community-platform.md for comprehensive research findings
- **Technical Path**: Users can navigate elements/ → technical/ → architecture.md for implementation details
- **Cross-Domain**: Clear relationships between research findings and technical implementation decisions

## Archive Actions
- Moved processed documents to archive/:
  - shareth-naming-report.md
  - privacy-community-app-research.md
  - privacy-community-app-tech-design.md
  - comprehensive-context-network-guide.md
  - custom-instructions-prompt.md

## Follow-up Recommendations
1. **Principles Document**: Update foundation/principles.md to reflect Shareth-specific values and guidelines
2. **Structure Document**: Update foundation/structure.md with project-specific organizational approach
3. **Planning Documents**: Update planning/roadmap.md and planning/milestones.md with Shareth timeline
4. **Additional Research**: Consider creating separate technical research documents for specific cryptographic approaches
5. **Legal Analysis**: Create dedicated legal/regulatory analysis document from research findings
6. **User Experience**: Create UX/design element category for user-facing design decisions
