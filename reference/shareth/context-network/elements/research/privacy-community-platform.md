# Privacy-Preserving Community Platform Research

## Purpose
Comprehensive research into building a privacy-preserving, decentralized mobile application for community organizing that balances strong privacy guarantees with effective abuse prevention.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Research
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established

## Executive Summary

This research synthesizes findings from cryptographic identity systems, real-world platform implementations, and legal frameworks to inform the design of Shareth as a non-profit, open-source solution for privacy-preserving community organizing.

## Core Problem Analysis

### The Fundamental Paradox
Modern community organizing faces a critical challenge: privacy features that protect legitimate users (protesters, mutual aid organizers, support groups) from surveillance also enable bad actors to operate with impunity.

### Current Platform Limitations
1. **Centralized platforms**: Collect extensive user data, vulnerable to subpoenas and breaches
2. **Fully anonymous systems**: Become havens for harassment and illegal activity
3. **Federated systems**: Struggle with coordinated moderation and technical complexity

### The School Bully Problem
Current moderation systems mirror institutional failures where:
- Sustained, low-level harassment is ignored until victims react strongly
- Documented aggressors exploit procedural rules
- Appeal processes favor those with time and resources
- Bad actors operate just below reportable thresholds
- Creates asymmetric warfare where harassers appear procedurally legitimate

## Key Technical Challenges

### 1. Identity and Account Recovery
- **Challenge**: Reliable recovery without centralized password resets
- **Considerations**:
  - Phone/email recovery creates surveillance vulnerabilities
  - Social recovery requires stable relationship maintenance
  - Biometric authentication raises privacy concerns

### 2. Trust Establishment
- **Challenge**: Verify humans vs. bots without identifying information
- **Considerations**:
  - Preventing Sybil attacks (multiple identities per person)
  - Establishing group membership without central authority
  - Building ungameable reputation systems

### 3. Content Moderation at Scale
- **Challenge**: Detect abuse without reading message content
- **Considerations**:
  - Preventing coordinated harassment campaigns
  - Handling context-dependent harm
  - Providing accountability without enabling retaliation

### 4. Legal Compliance vs. Privacy
- **Challenge**: Balance legal requirements with privacy guarantees
- **Considerations**:
  - Government data demands
  - Platform liability for content
  - Cross-jurisdictional enforcement

## Research Findings

### Cryptographic Identity Solutions

#### Social Recovery Mechanisms
- **Implementation**: Argent and Loopring wallets demonstrate viability
- **Method**: Threshold requirements (e.g., 3-of-5 guardians)
- **Benefits**: No single point of failure, resilient to guardian issues
- **Best for**: High-trust communities with stable relationships

#### Threshold Signature Schemes (TSS)
- **Protocols**: GG20, CMP enable distributed key management
- **Performance**: Internet Computer Protocol achieves sub-second signing
- **Considerations**: Recent vulnerabilities require continuous review
- **Complexity**: Requires abstraction layers for user deployment

#### Multi-Party Computation (MPC)
- **Implementation**: Web3Auth achieves <1.2 second latency
- **Security**: AWS Nitro Enclaves for enterprise deployments
- **Bottleneck**: Network latency between parties
- **Requirement**: Key refresh protocols for long-term security

#### Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems
- **Advances**: zk-STARKs eliminate trusted setup
- **Efficiency**: 100-300 byte proofs, millisecond verification
- **Applications**: Cloudflare's Private Access Tokens for rate limiting
- **Limitation**: Circuit design for moderation rules computationally expensive

### Physical Proximity Trust

#### Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- **Example**: Apple/Google Exposure Notification API
- **Privacy**: Rolling cryptographic identifiers (10-20 minute rotation)
- **Security**: AES encryption with daily key rotation
- **Challenge**: Signal strength varies with environment

#### Near Field Communication (NFC)
- **Security**: 4cm range prevents relay attacks
- **Deployment**: Government IDs demonstrate reliability
- **Authentication**: PACE provides mutual authentication
- **Performance**: Sub-second verification

#### QR Code Authentication
- **Examples**: Signal safety numbers, WebAuthn Hybrid
- **Benefit**: Visual channel prevents network attacks
- **User Experience**: Intuitive and accessible

### Decentralized Moderation Approaches

#### Threshold Reporting with K-Anonymity
- **Implementation**: Wikipedia's differential privacy for pageviews
- **Detection**: Tor identified 23% malicious exit capacity
- **Tradeoff**: Smaller anonymity sets = faster detection but less privacy
- **Vulnerability**: Background knowledge attacks

#### Community Governance Models
- **Example**: Kleros decentralized arbitration
- **Success**: 90% acceptance rates for legitimate submissions
- **Mechanism**: Token-curated registries create skin-in-the-game
- **Challenge**: Preventing majority tyranny and Sybil attacks

## Platform Implementation Analysis

### Signal: Privacy Maximalism
- **Data**: Only Unix timestamps for creation/last connection
- **Stance**: Exit markets rather than compromise encryption
- **Architecture**: Minimal data collection enforced technically
- **Trust**: Open-source clients, reproducible builds, sealed sender

### Session: Decentralized Architecture
- **Innovation**: No phone numbers, onion routing for metadata
- **Tradeoff**: Sacrificed perfect forward secrecy for anonymity
- **Challenge**: Complicates abuse response, adds latency

### Briar: Offline-First P2P
- **Architecture**: Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and Tor communication
- **Strength**: Maximum censorship resistance
- **Limitations**: iOS restrictions, UX complexity, no cross-device history

### Matrix/Element: Federation Model
- **Moderation**: Multi-level (room, server, network)
- **Challenge**: Server operators become liability targets
- **Issue**: Inconsistent policies across servers confuse users

## Legal and Regulatory Landscape

### Data Minimization as Defense
- **Strategy**: Minimal data = fewer legal obligations
- **Reality**: FBI often bypasses encryption via cloud backups

### Regulatory Pressure Points

#### EU Chat Control (Target: October 2025)
- Would mandate client-side scanning for CSAM
- European Court ruled general weakening violates democratic principles
- Creates significant legal uncertainty

#### UK Online Safety Act
- Requires "accredited technology" for harmful content
- Technical feasibility thresholds prevent current enforcement
- Platform exit threats led to softened approach

#### US Section 230 Reform
- EARN IT and STOP CSAM Acts condition immunity on "best practices"
- Effectively mandates scanning capabilities
- Ongoing legislative uncertainty

### Jurisdictional Strategies
- Data localization conflicts with decentralization
- Warrant canaries provide limited transparency
- Jurisdictional arbitrage offers temporary protection

## Sybil Resistance Mechanisms

### Proof of Personhood
- **BrightID**: Social graph analysis, 100,000+ verified identities
- **Worldcoin**: Iris scanning with ZK proofs via Semaphore
- **Vulnerability**: Social graphs susceptible to targeted attacks

### Resource-Based Verification
- **Computational**: Proof-of-work for account creation
- **Economic**: Small deposits or fees
- **Time**: Account aging and activity requirements

## Implications for Shareth

### Architecture Recommendations
1. Implement social recovery with guardian systems
2. Use threshold signatures for distributed key management
3. Deploy zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification
4. Combine multiple trust mechanisms (proximity, social, time)

### Moderation Strategy
1. Community-driven governance with clear policies
2. Threshold reporting with privacy preservation
3. Reputation systems based on contribution not punishment
4. Focus on restoration over retaliation

### Legal Positioning
1. Minimize data collection architecturally
2. Prepare for potential market exits
3. Consider jurisdictional placement carefully
4. Build with assumption of adversarial regulation
