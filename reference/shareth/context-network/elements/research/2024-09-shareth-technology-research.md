- **Memory usage** varies significantly between implementations

**Performance Benchmarks:**
| Operation | Libsodium | TweetNaCl | Performance Ratio |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Ed25519 signing (10B) | 13,301 ops/sec | ~590 ops/sec | 22.5x faster |
| Ed25519 verification (10B) | 5,575 ops/sec | ~250 ops/sec | 22.3x faster |
| Key generation | 10,290 ops/sec | ~930 ops/sec | 11x faster |

**Decision Impact:** Selected libsodium via react-native-sodium for Shareth implementation.

### 2. Signal Protocol vs. Alternatives

**Research Question:** What messaging protocol provides the best security and performance for mobile group messaging?

**Key Findings:**
- **Signal Protocol** remains the gold standard for E2EE messaging
- **Matrix Olm** has known security vulnerabilities (AES cache timing attacks in 2024)
- **MLS (Messaging Layer Security)** is emerging for large group messaging but still maturing
- **Signal Protocol** has extensive auditing and proven security record

**Security Analysis:**
- Matrix Olm vulnerabilities were known but deliberately not fixed for years
- Signal Protocol has undergone extensive formal verification
- MLS specification (RFC 9420) designed for group messaging scalability

**Decision Impact:** Use Signal Protocol for 1:1 messaging, consider MLS for future large group implementations.

### 3. CRDT Library Performance Comparison

**Research Question:** Which CRDT implementation provides the best performance for React Native distributed state management?

**Key Findings:**
- **Yjs** dramatically outperforms alternatives (30x faster than reference implementations)
- **Automerge v1** shows 300x performance penalty compared to Yjs
- **Automerge v2** improved significantly (86% faster, 75% less memory) but still 2x slower than Yjs
- **Memory efficiency** is critical factor for mobile devices

**Performance Benchmarks:**
| Test | Automerge v1 | Automerge v2 | Yjs | Performance Ratio |
|------|--------------|--------------|-----|-------------------|
| 260k edit operations | 291s | ~13s | 0.97s | 300x / 13x faster |
| Memory usage | 880MB | ~45MB | 3.3MB | 270x / 14x less |
| Final document size | ~100k chars | ~100k chars | ~100k chars | Same output |

**Decision Impact:** Selected Yjs for all CRDT operations in Shareth.

### 4. Privacy-Preserving Voting Mechanisms

**Research Question:** What cryptographic approach enables anonymous voting with mobile-friendly performance?

**Key Findings:**
- **Groth16 zk-SNARKs** provide extremely small proof sizes (<200 bytes)
- **BBS signatures** offer flexible credential verification for voter registration
- **Ring signatures** have linear proof size growth limiting scalability
- **zk-STARKs** have no trusted setup but much larger proofs (10-100KB)

**Technical Comparison:**
| Approach | Proof Size | Setup Required | Mobile Suitable | Privacy Level |
|----------|------------|----------------|-----------------|---------------|
| Groth16 | <200 bytes | Yes (trusted) | Excellent | High |
| zk-STARKs | 10-100KB | No | Poor | High |
| Ring Signatures | Linear growth | No | Moderate | Medium |
| Homomorphic | Large ciphertexts | No | Poor | High |

**Decision Impact:** Use Groth16 zk-SNARKs with BBS signatures for voting implementation.

### 5. P2P Networking for Mobile

**Research Question:** What P2P networking approach works best for offline-first mobile applications?

**Key Findings:**
- **WebRTC** provides robust internet-based P2P with NAT traversal
- **Bridgefy** offers proven Bluetooth mesh networking for offline scenarios
- **Offline-first architecture** requires multiple networking layers for resilience
- **Battery optimization** critical for Bluetooth mesh operations

**Networking Capabilities:**
| Technology | Range | Bandwidth | Offline Support | Battery Impact |
|------------|-------|-----------|-----------------|----------------|
| WebRTC | Global (internet) | High | No | Low |
| Bridgefy Bluetooth | ~100m mesh | Low | Yes | Medium |
| WiFi Direct | ~200m | High | Limited | Medium |

**Decision Impact:** Implement dual-layer approach: WebRTC + Bridgefy mesh networking.

### 6. Mutual Aid Platform Analysis

**Research Question:** What features and patterns work best for community resource coordination?

**Key Findings:**
- **Time banking** shows strong community engagement (500k+ members globally)
- **Equal time valuation** (1 hour = 1 credit) promotes participation
- **Coordination tools** like Zelos provide task dispatch capabilities
- **Community ownership** essential for sustainable mutual aid

**Platform Examples:**
- **TimeBanks.org**: 48 countries, emphasis on community building
