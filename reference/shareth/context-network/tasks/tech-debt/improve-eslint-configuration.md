# Improve ESLint Configuration for React Native

## Purpose
Enhance ESLint configuration to include React Native specific rules and security-focused linting for the Shareth project.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Code Quality
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established

## Task Details

### Original Recommendation
Development environment tests expect more comprehensive ESLint configuration:
- Missing `@react-native-community/eslint-config`
- React Native specific rules not configured
- Security-focused linting rules need enhancement

### Why Deferred
- **Medium Effort**: Requires research into best React Native ESLint practices
- **Team Decision**: ESLint rules affect team coding standards
- **Risk of Conflicts**: New rules might conflict with existing code style

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Install and configure `@react-native-community/eslint-config`
- [ ] Add React Native specific linting rules
- [ ] Configure security-focused rules appropriate for privacy app
- [ ] Ensure rules work well with TypeScript
- [ ] Update CI/CD to enforce linting standards
- [ ] Document any custom rule decisions

### Implementation Notes
1. **Package Installation**:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @react-native-community/eslint-config
   ```

2. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Extend from React Native community config
   - Add react-native plugin rules
   - Configure accessibility linting
   - Add security-specific rules

3. **Rule Categories to Consider**:
   - React Native performance rules
   - Accessibility guidelines
   - Security best practices
   - Code style consistency
   - Import/export organization

### Security Considerations
For a privacy-focused app like Shareth, consider rules for:
- Preventing console.log in production
- Detecting potential data leaks
- Enforcing secure coding patterns
- Validating crypto-related code patterns

### Dependencies
- Review of React Native community standards
- Team agreement on coding standards
- Integration with existing TypeScript setup

### Effort Estimate
Small to Medium (15-45 minutes) - depends on complexity of rule configuration

### Priority
Low - Code quality improvement but not blocking development
