# Enhance Jest and Testing Configuration

## Purpose
Improve Jest configuration and testing setup to follow React Native best practices and support the Shareth development workflow.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Testing
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established

## Task Details

### Original Recommendation
Development environment tests indicate missing testing configuration:
- Jest configuration not properly set up for React Native
- Missing React Native testing utilities setup
- Test coverage configuration needed

### Why Deferred
- **Medium Effort**: Requires research into React Native testing best practices
- **Dependencies**: Should be coordinated with overall testing strategy
- **Team Decision**: Testing configuration affects development workflow

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create proper `jest.config.js` for React Native
- [ ] Configure test environment for React Native components
- [ ] Set up testing utilities and helpers
- [ ] Configure test coverage reporting
- [ ] Add snapshot testing configuration
- [ ] Document testing conventions and examples

### Implementation Notes
1. **Jest Configuration**:
   - Create `jest.config.js` with React Native preset
   - Configure test environment and setup files
   - Set up module name mapping for absolute imports
   - Configure coverage collection

2. **Testing Utilities**:
   - Set up @testing-library/react-native properly
   - Remove deprecated @testing-library/jest-native
   - Add custom render helpers
   - Configure test data and mocks

3. **Coverage and Reporting**:
   - Configure coverage thresholds
   - Set up HTML coverage reports
   - Exclude appropriate files from coverage

### Testing Strategy Considerations
For Shareth's needs:
- Component testing for UI elements
- Integration testing for crypto operations
- Mock strategies for P2P networking
- Security testing patterns

### Dependencies
- Review of React Native testing best practices
- Decision on testing coverage requirements
- Integration with CI/CD pipeline

### Effort Estimate
Medium (30-60 minutes) - requires careful configuration and testing

### Priority
Medium - Important for development quality but not blocking initial work
