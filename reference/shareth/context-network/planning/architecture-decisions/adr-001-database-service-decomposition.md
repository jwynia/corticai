# ADR-001: Database Service Decomposition Strategy

**Status**: Implemented
**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Decision**: Decompose DatabaseService into focused modules using TDD

## Context

DatabaseService had grown to 977 lines with mixed responsibilities:
- Connection management
- Transaction handling
- Schema/migration operations
- Encryption management
- Key derivation
- SQL execution

This violated Single Responsibility Principle and made testing difficult.

## Decision

Decompose DatabaseService into specialized modules:
1. **TransactionManager** - Transaction lifecycle and queueing
2. **ConnectionManager** - Connection state and SQL execution
3. **SchemaManager** - Migrations and schema operations
4. **DatabaseService** - Facade maintaining backward compatibility

## Approach

Use Test-Driven Development for extraction:
1. Write comprehensive tests for new module FIRST
2. Extract functionality to pass tests
3. Delegate from DatabaseService
4. Maintain 100% backward compatibility

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Improved maintainability**: 40.5% size reduction (977→582 lines)
- **Better testability**: Modules can be tested in isolation
- **Clear responsibilities**: Each module has single purpose
- **Zero breaking changes**: Facade pattern preserves all APIs
- **Team scalability**: Developers can work on modules independently

### Negative
- **Increased file count**: 4 modules instead of 1
- **Indirection layer**: Facade adds slight complexity
- **Test maintenance**: 60+ new tests to maintain

### Neutral
- **Performance**: No measurable impact (delegation overhead negligible)
- **Memory**: Slight increase from multiple module instances

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Keep Monolithic Structure
- **Pros**: Simple file structure, no refactoring effort
- **Cons**: Growing maintenance burden, difficult testing
- **Rejected**: Technical debt would compound

### 2. Complete Rewrite
- **Pros**: Clean slate, optimal design
- **Cons**: High risk, breaking changes, time investment
- **Rejected**: Too risky for production code

### 3. Partial Extraction (only TransactionManager)
- **Pros**: Less effort, some improvement
- **Cons**: Incomplete solution, remaining mixed responsibilities
- **Rejected**: Insufficient improvement

## Implementation Details

### Module Boundaries
```
DatabaseService (582 lines) - Facade & Encryption
├── TransactionManager (237 lines) - Transactions
├── ConnectionManager (261 lines) - Connections
└── SchemaManager (338 lines) - Schema/Migrations
```

### Delegation Pattern
```javascript
class DatabaseService {
  async executeSql(sql, params) {
    return this._connectionManager.executeSql(sql, params);
  }

  async runMigration(migration) {
    return this._schemaManager.runMigration(migration);
  }
}
```

### Test Coverage
- Each module has dedicated test suite
- 60+ tests added using TDD
- All tests passing before integration

## Validation Metrics

- **Size reduction**: 40.5% (395 lines extracted)
- **Test coverage**: High coverage for new modules
- **Breaking changes**: 0
- **ESLint violations**: 0
- **Performance impact**: None measured

## Future Considerations

### Remaining Extractions
- **KeyManagementService**: Extract key operations (~150 lines)
- **EncryptionService**: Extract encryption logic (~100 lines)
- **Target**: Reduce DatabaseService to <300 lines

### Lessons for Future Decomposition
1. Always use TDD for extraction
2. Maintain backward compatibility via facades
3. Extract incrementally, not all at once
4. Ensure test isolation from the start
5. Document extraction patterns for reuse
