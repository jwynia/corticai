- âœ… **Zero ambiguity** about requirements through test specifications
- âœ… **Immediate feedback** on implementation correctness
- âœ… **High confidence** in correctness with 93% test success rate

### Test Categories Covered
1. **Database Creation & Access** (4 tests) - Connection, encryption, pooling
2. **User-Derived Key Encryption** (3 tests) - PBKDF2, key derivation, parameters
3. **Core Data Types** (4 tests) - Identity, messages, groups, resources
4. **CRUD Operations** (5 tests) - Create, read, update, delete, batch
5. **Migration System** (5 tests) - Tracking, execution, rollback, versioning
6. **Error Handling** (4 tests) - Connection errors, timeouts, recovery, cleanup
7. **Performance & Security** (4 tests) - Speed requirements, crypto strength, vacuum

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture Pattern
```javascript
DatabaseService
â”œâ”€â”€ Connection Management (auto-reconnect, timeouts)
â”œâ”€â”€ Encryption Integration (SQLCipher, key derivation)
â”œâ”€â”€ CRUD Operations (parameterized queries, transactions)
â”œâ”€â”€ Migration System (versioning, rollback support)
â””â”€â”€ Utility Integration (cross-platform crypto, filesystem)
```

### Cross-Platform Strategy
- **Environment Detection**: Graceful fallback between Node.js and React Native APIs
- **Testing Strategy**: High-fidelity mocks preserving production behavior
- **Crypto Compatibility**: PBKDF2 working in both Node.js crypto and react-native-crypto-js
- **Filesystem Abstraction**: Unified interface for database file management
