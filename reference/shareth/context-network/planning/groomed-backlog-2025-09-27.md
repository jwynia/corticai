# Groomed Task Backlog - 2025-09-27

## üöÄ Ready for Implementation

### 1. Fix Transaction Test Edge Cases
**One-liner**: Make database transaction tests bulletproof with comprehensive edge case handling
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Files to modify**:
- `__tests__/database-service-transaction.test.js`
- `src/services/database/DatabaseService.js`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Transaction tests need comprehensive edge case coverage to ensure database reliability under all conditions. This is critical for maintaining data integrity in a decentralized application.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All transaction tests pass consistently (no flaky tests)
- [ ] Nested transaction handling properly tested
- [ ] Transaction timeout scenarios covered with proper cleanup
- [ ] Rollback verification on all error types (syntax, constraint, runtime)
- [ ] Proper isolation between test runs (no test pollution)
- [ ] Concurrent transaction behavior documented and tested

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Review current transaction test failures and identify patterns
2. Add proper setup/teardown to ensure test isolation
3. Implement nested transaction test cases
4. Add timeout handling with configurable durations
5. Test rollback scenarios for each error type
6. Verify transaction state management
7. Add concurrent transaction tests

**Watch Out For**:
- SQLite transaction limitations (no true nested transactions)
- Test timing issues in CI/CD environments
- Memory leaks from unclosed transactions
- Platform-specific transaction behavior differences

### 2. DatabaseService Architecture Split
**One-liner**: Refactor monolithic DatabaseService into focused, maintainable modules
**Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Files to modify**:
- `src/services/database/DatabaseService.js` ‚Üí Split into modules
- Create: `QueryBuilder.js`, `TransactionManager.js`, `ConnectionPool.js`, `SchemaManager.js`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: With 236/236 tests passing and a solid foundation, we can safely refactor the 400+ line DatabaseService into focused modules without breaking functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] DatabaseService split into 4-5 focused modules (each < 200 lines)
- [ ] All existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API
- [ ] Performance maintained or improved
- [ ] Each module has single responsibility
- [ ] Clear module interfaces documented
- [ ] Dependency injection pattern maintained

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Create module structure:
   - `QueryBuilder.js` - SQL query construction
   - `TransactionManager.js` - Transaction lifecycle
   - `ConnectionPool.js` - Connection management
   - `SchemaManager.js` - Schema operations
   - `DatabaseService.js` - Orchestration layer
2. Extract functionality module by module
3. Maintain backward compatibility through facade pattern
4. Run full test suite after each extraction
5. Update imports in dependent services
6. Performance benchmark before/after

**Watch Out For**:
- Circular dependencies between modules
- Breaking encapsulation of private methods
- Performance regression from additional layers
- Test coupling to internal implementation

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling System
**One-liner**: Implement comprehensive error management with proper error types and recovery strategies
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Files to modify**:
- Create: `src/utils/errors/` directory structure
- `src/utils/errors/BaseError.js`
- `src/utils/errors/DatabaseError.js`
- `src/utils/errors/NetworkError.js`
- `src/utils/errors/ValidationError.js`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: With ESLint cleanup complete and zero errors, we can implement a robust error handling system that provides meaningful error messages and recovery strategies.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Custom error classes for each error category
- [ ] Error serialization for logging and debugging
- [ ] Stack trace preservation across async boundaries
- [ ] Error recovery strategies defined
- [ ] Integration with existing LoggerService
- [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Error metrics collection hooks

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Create BaseError class with common functionality
2. Implement specific error types extending BaseError
3. Add error codes and categories
4. Integrate with LoggerService for automatic logging
5. Add error boundary components for React Native
6. Implement error recovery middleware
7. Add error analytics hooks

**Watch Out For**:
- Error message leaking sensitive information
- Stack trace size in production
- Circular references in error objects
- Performance impact of stack trace capture

## ‚è≥ Ready Soon (Blocked by Priority)

### iOS and Android Platform Configuration
**Blocker**: Higher priority tasks in progress
**Estimated unblock**: After core tasks complete
**Prep work possible**: Review current platform configurations
**Effort**: 30-60 minutes

### Improve ESLint Configuration
**Blocker**: Current configuration working well (zero errors)
**Estimated unblock**: When React Native specific rules needed
**Prep work possible**: Research @react-native-community/eslint-config
**Effort**: 15-45 minutes

### Enhance Jest and Testing Configuration
**Blocker**: Current test suite fully passing
**Estimated unblock**: When component testing begins
**Prep work possible**: Document testing strategy for React Native components
**Effort**: 30-60 minutes

## üîç Needs Decisions

### Fix Jest Conditional Expect Violations
**Decision needed**: Should we tackle all 74 violations at once or incrementally?
**Options**:
1. **Batch fix** - Address all in one focused effort (7-9 hours)
   - Pros: Consistent approach, one-time disruption
   - Cons: Large time investment, risk of test regression
2. **Incremental** - Fix as we touch test files (ongoing)
   - Pros: Lower risk, continuous improvement
   - Cons: Inconsistent codebase, longer to complete
**Recommendation**: Incremental approach as tests are modified for features

### Long-term Feature Development Phases
**Decision needed**: When to begin Phase 1 foundation features?
**Options**:
1. **Start immediately** - Begin cryptographic implementation
   - Pros: Progress on core features, early validation
   - Cons: May need refactoring as architecture evolves
2. **Complete all infrastructure first** - Finish all tech debt/setup
   - Pros: Solid foundation, less rework
   - Cons: Delays feature delivery
**Recommendation**: Start with lighter Phase 1 tasks (database encryption) while completing infrastructure

## üóëÔ∏è Archived Tasks

### Index File TODO Cleanup - **Reason**: Completed 2025-09-27

- Archived (completed): 6
- Long-term roadmap: 27

## Top 3 Recommendations

1. **Fix Transaction Test Edge Cases** - Critical for data integrity, unblocks all database-dependent features
2. **DatabaseService Architecture Split** - Improves maintainability while tests are green, prevents future tech debt
3. **Enhanced Error Handling System** - Foundation for robust user experience and debugging

## Project Health Assessment

‚úÖ **Strengths**:
- All tests passing (236/236)
- Zero ESLint errors/warnings
- Clean architecture decisions documented
- Strong foundation established

‚ö†Ô∏è **Watch Areas**:
- 74 conditional expect violations (tech debt)
- Platform configurations not yet customized
- Large Phase 1 features not started

üéØ **Next Sprint Focus**:
Complete the three ready tasks to establish an even stronger foundation before beginning Phase 1 cryptographic features. This will ensure robust error handling, clean architecture, and bulletproof database operations for all future development.
