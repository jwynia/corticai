# Feature Roadmap Planning

## Purpose
This document provides a comprehensive feature roadmap for the Shareth privacy-preserving community platform, organizing all project scope features into logical phases and implementation sequences.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Planning Overview

This roadmap breaks down the Shareth platform development into logical phases, each building upon the previous while maintaining the core principles of privacy, community ownership, and decentralization.

### Core Principles Driving the Roadmap
1. **Foundation First**: Establish secure, private foundations before adding features
2. **Incremental Value**: Each phase delivers usable value to target communities
3. **Privacy by Design**: Security and privacy considerations integrated from the start
4. **Community-Driven**: Features prioritized based on community organizing needs
5. **Sustainable Growth**: Technical debt and complexity managed throughout

### Roadmap Structure

The roadmap is organized into six major phases:

1. **Foundation Phase**: Core identity, security, and basic communication
2. **Community Phase**: Group formation, governance, and moderation tools
3. **Resource Phase**: Mutual aid coordination and resource sharing
4. **Discovery Phase**: Network effects and community interconnection
5. **Resilience Phase**: Advanced decentralization and fault tolerance
6. **Ecosystem Phase**: Platform extensibility and community customization

### Dependencies and Constraints

#### Technical Dependencies
- Mobile platform capabilities (iOS/Android)
- Cryptographic library availability
- P2P networking limitations
- Battery and performance constraints

#### Community Dependencies
- Early adopter communities for testing
- Security audit partnerships
- Open-source contributor availability
- Grant funding and sustainability planning

#### Legal and Regulatory Constraints
- Data protection regulations (GDPR, etc.)
- Content moderation requirements
- Cross-border communication laws
- Platform liability considerations
