# Implementation Readiness Checklist

## Purpose
Defines the readiness criteria that must be met before beginning implementation of each phase in the Shareth feature roadmap.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Planning
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Overview

This checklist ensures that each phase of development has the necessary prerequisites in place before implementation begins. The goal is to prevent starting work without proper preparation, which could lead to technical debt, security vulnerabilities, or community adoption challenges.

### Readiness Principles
1. **Clear Understanding**: Problem and solution space fully explored
2. **Technical Preparation**: Architecture and technical decisions made
3. **Resource Availability**: People, tools, and funding in place
4. **Community Alignment**: Target users understand and support the approach
5. **Risk Mitigation**: Major risks identified and mitigation plans prepared
