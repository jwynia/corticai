# Groomed Task Backlog - 2025-10-02

## ‚úÖ Just Completed

### DatabaseService Decomposition (Phases 2-3)
- Extracted ConnectionManager (261 lines) with 30 tests
- Extracted SchemaManager (338 lines) with 30 tests
- Reduced DatabaseService from 977 ‚Üí 582 lines (40.5% reduction)
- Zero breaking changes using facade pattern
- 100% TDD approach - tests written before implementation
- ESLint clean (0 errors, 0 warnings)

## üöÄ Ready for Implementation

### 1. Fix DatabaseService Integration Test Failures
**One-liner**: Fix 21 failing tests by properly initializing SchemaManager in test setup
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Files to modify**:
- Database test files that mock DatabaseService
- Need to mock/initialize SchemaManager in beforeEach

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: After extracting SchemaManager, 21 integration tests are failing because they don't initialize the new _schemaManager property.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All 324 tests passing
- [ ] No regression in test functionality
- [ ] Proper mocking of SchemaManager in tests

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Identify all failing test files
2. Add SchemaManager mock to test setup
3. Ensure proper initialization in DatabaseService constructor mocks
4. Verify all tests pass

**Watch Out For**:
- Different test setup patterns in different test files
- Ensuring mocks match actual SchemaManager interface

### 2. Extract KeyManagementService (Optional Phase 6)
**One-liner**: Extract key derivation, rotation, and validation logic from DatabaseService
**Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Files to modify**:
- Create: `src/services/database/KeyManagementService.js`
- Modify: `src/services/database/DatabaseService.js`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: DatabaseService still contains ~150 lines of key management logic that could be extracted.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Extract all key derivation methods
- [ ] Extract key rotation logic
- [ ] Extract password validation
- [ ] DatabaseService < 450 lines
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] TDD approach followed

**Methods to Extract**:
- createUserDerivedKey()
- deriveIdentityKey()
- rotateEncryptionKey()
- validatePasswordStrength()
- getKeyRotationHistory()

</details>

### 3. Extract EncryptionService (Optional Phase 7)
**One-liner**: Extract encryption-specific operations from DatabaseService
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Files to modify**:
- Create: `src/services/database/EncryptionService.js`
- Modify: `src/services/database/DatabaseService.js`

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Final extraction to reach target of DatabaseService < 300 lines.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Extract encryption metadata methods
- [ ] Extract encryption enable/disable logic
- [ ] DatabaseService < 300 lines (target achieved)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] TDD approach followed

</details>

## ‚è≥ Ready Soon (Lower Priority)

### QueryBuilder Extraction (Phase 4)
**Blocker**: Limited benefit as few query building utilities exist
**Estimated effort**: 1-2 hours
**Value**: Low - DatabaseService doesn't have significant query building logic

### Platform-Specific Configurations
**Blocker**: Core architecture work taking priority
**Estimated effort**: 30-60 minutes
**Next window**: After integration tests fixed

## üîç Needs Decisions

### Further Decomposition Strategy
**Decision needed**: Should we continue extracting to reach <300 line target?
**Options**:
1. **Stop at current state** (582 lines)
   - Pros: Already 40% reduction, good enough
   - Cons: Still above ideal module size
2. **Extract KeyManagement only** (~450 lines final)
   - Pros: Significant improvement, moderate effort
   - Cons: Doesn't reach target
3. **Full extraction** (<300 lines final)
   - Pros: Reaches target, maximum maintainability
   - Cons: More files to manage
**Recommendation**: Option 2 - Extract KeyManagement for best ROI

## Summary Statistics
- Total tasks reviewed: 10
- Completed today: 3 major extractions
- Ready for work: 3
- Blocked/Low priority: 2
- Architecture improvements: Significant

## Top 3 Recommendations

1. **Fix integration tests immediately** - Blocking CI/CD pipeline
2. **Extract KeyManagementService** - Good ROI for effort
3. **Document new architecture** - Help team understand new module structure

## Project Architecture Health

‚úÖ **Improvements Made**:
- DatabaseService reduced by 40.5%
- Clear separation of concerns achieved
- TDD pattern established and proven
- Zero breaking changes during major refactor

‚ö†Ô∏è **Remaining Issues**:
- 21 test failures need fixing
- DatabaseService still 582 lines (target: <300)
- Documentation needs updating

üéØ **Next Sprint Focus**:
Fix test failures to restore CI/CD health, then consider KeyManagementService extraction if time permits. The architecture is already significantly improved even without further extraction.
