## üö® CRITICAL - Ready for Implementation

### 1. Fix DatabaseService Integration Test Failures
**Status**: 19 failing tests blocking CI/CD pipeline
**One-liner**: Fix failing integration tests by properly initializing SchemaManager and fixing error handling
**Effort**: 2-3 hours (more complex than originally estimated)
**Complexity**: Medium (now involves multiple error types and initialization patterns)

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: After extracting SchemaManager and ConnectionManager, 19 integration tests are failing due to:
1. Missing SchemaManager initialization in test setup
2. Error type mismatches (SqlError vs expected error types)
3. Connection timeout handling changes
4. Migration state management issues

**Root Causes Identified**:
- `error-integration.test.js`: 3 failures related to error type changes
- `database-setup.test.js`: 16 failures related to SchemaManager and ConnectionManager integration

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All 324 tests passing (currently 305 passing, 19 failing)
- [ ] No regression in test functionality
- [ ] Proper initialization of all managers in test setup
- [ ] Error types match expected patterns
- [ ] Connection timeout handling works as expected

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Fix SchemaManager test initialization**:
   - Update test setup in database-setup.test.js
   - Ensure proper manager initialization order
   - Fix migration map access patterns

2. **Fix error type mismatches**:
   - Update error-integration.test.js expectations
   - Align SqlError vs ConnectionClosedError/ValidationError usage
   - Fix timeout error handling expectations

3. **Fix connection management**:
   - Restore proper connection state checking
   - Fix timeout implementation in ConnectionManager
   - Ensure proper cleanup sequences

**Files to modify**:
- `__tests__/database-setup.test.js`
- `src/services/database/__tests__/error-integration.test.js`
- Potentially manager initialization patterns

## üöÄ Ready for Implementation

### 2. Extract KeyManagementService (Optional Phase 4)
**One-liner**: Extract key derivation, rotation, and validation logic from DatabaseService
**Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Complexity**: Large

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: DatabaseService still contains ~150 lines of key management logic that could be extracted.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Extract all key derivation methods (PBKDF2 operations)
- [ ] Extract key rotation logic
- [ ] Extract password validation
- [ ] DatabaseService < 450 lines
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] TDD approach followed

**Methods to Extract**:
- createUserDerivedKey()
- deriveIdentityKey()
- rotateEncryptionKey()
- validatePasswordStrength()
- getKeyRotationHistory()

**Benefits**:
- Further reduces DatabaseService size
- Improves separation of concerns
- Makes key management logic more testable

</details>

### 3. Extract EncryptionService (Optional Phase 5)
**One-liner**: Extract encryption-specific operations from DatabaseService
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Complexity**: Medium

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Final extraction to reach target of DatabaseService < 300 lines.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Extract encryption metadata methods
- [ ] Extract encryption enable/disable logic
- [ ] DatabaseService < 300 lines (target achieved)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] TDD approach followed

**Remaining in DatabaseService**: Core orchestration and facade methods only

</details>

### 4. Fix Transaction Timeout Memory Leak
**One-liner**: Fix timeout handlers not being cleared when transactions complete first
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Complexity**: Small

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Potential memory leak in transaction timeout handling where timeout handlers are not cleared when the main transaction promise resolves first.

**Status**: **MOSTLY RESOLVED** ‚úÖ by TransactionManager extraction, but needs verification

**Verification Steps**:
- [ ] Review TransactionManager timeout implementation
- [ ] Add specific memory leak test
- [ ] Verify cleanup is working in all scenarios

**Note**: This may already be resolved by the TransactionManager refactor, but needs explicit verification.

</details>

## ‚è≥ Ready Soon (Lower Priority)

### Platform Configuration Tasks

#### iOS and Android Bundle Configuration
**Blocker**: Requires team decision on final bundle identifiers
**Effort**: 30-60 minutes
**Files to modify**:
- `ios/shareth/Info.plist`
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`

#### React Native Testing Configuration Enhancement
**Blocker**: Should be done after current test failures are resolved
**Effort**: 30-60 minutes
**Value**: Improves development workflow

#### ESLint Configuration Improvements
**Blocker**: Low priority code quality improvement
**Effort**: 15-45 minutes
**Value**: Better code standards enforcement

### Architecture Tasks (Lower Priority)

#### QueryBuilder Extraction (Phase 6)
**Status**: Limited benefit identified
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Value**: Low - DatabaseService doesn't have significant query building logic

#### Refactor _executeTransaction Method
**Status**: **OBSOLETE** ‚úÖ - Resolved by TransactionManager extraction
**Note**: This task is no longer needed as TransactionManager extraction accomplished the same goals

## üîç Needs Decisions

### Decomposition Strategy Decision
**Decision needed**: Should we continue extracting to reach <300 line target?

**Options**:
1. **Stop at current state** (582 lines)
   - Pros: Already 40% reduction, significant improvement achieved
   - Cons: Still above ideal module size, some key management complexity remains

2. **Extract KeyManagement only** (~450 lines final)
   - Pros: Good ROI, moderate effort, addresses key management complexity
   - Cons: Doesn't reach target, still relatively large

3. **Full extraction** (<300 lines final)
   - Pros: Reaches target, maximum maintainability, complete separation of concerns
   - Cons: More files to manage, higher complexity

**Recommendation**: Option 2 - Extract KeyManagement for best ROI, then evaluate
