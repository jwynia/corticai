## üöÄ Ready for Implementation (High Value)

### 1. Extract KeyManagementService (Optional Phase 4)
**One-liner**: Extract key derivation, rotation, and validation logic from DatabaseService
**Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Complexity**: Large
**Value**: High - Further architectural improvement

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: DatabaseService still contains ~150 lines of key management logic that could be extracted.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Extract all key derivation methods (PBKDF2 operations)
- [ ] Extract key rotation logic
- [ ] Extract password validation
- [ ] DatabaseService < 450 lines
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] TDD approach followed

**Methods to Extract**:
- createUserDerivedKey()
- deriveIdentityKey()
- rotateEncryptionKey()
- validatePasswordStrength()
- getKeyRotationHistory()

**Benefits**:
- Further reduces DatabaseService size by ~150 lines
- Improves separation of concerns for key management
- Makes key management logic more testable in isolation
- Provides foundation for advanced key rotation features

</details>

### 2. Extract EncryptionService (Optional Phase 5)
**One-liner**: Extract encryption-specific operations from DatabaseService
**Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Complexity**: Medium
**Value**: Medium - Completes decomposition goal

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: Final extraction to reach target of DatabaseService < 300 lines.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Extract encryption metadata methods
- [ ] Extract encryption enable/disable logic
- [ ] DatabaseService < 300 lines (target achieved)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] TDD approach followed

**Benefits**:
- Achieves target architecture goal (<300 lines)
- Complete separation of concerns
- Maximum maintainability achieved

</details>

### 3. Document New Database Architecture
**One-liner**: Create comprehensive documentation for the new modular database architecture
**Effort**: 1-2 hours
**Complexity**: Small
**Value**: High - Team enablement

<details>
<summary>Full Implementation Details</summary>

**Context**: The database architecture has significantly changed and needs documentation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Architecture diagram showing module relationships
- [ ] API documentation for each manager
- [ ] Migration guide from old to new architecture
- [ ] Best practices for working with new modules

**Benefits**:
- Enables team to understand new architecture
- Prevents future architectural drift
- Provides reference for similar refactoring

</details>

## ‚è≥ Ready Soon (Platform/Infrastructure)

### 4. Platform Configuration Tasks
**Effort**: 1-2 hours total
**Complexity**: Small
**Value**: Medium - Deployment enablement

#### iOS and Android Bundle Configuration
- Update bundle identifiers for production
- Configure app icons and launch screens
- Set up proper signing configurations

#### React Native Testing Configuration Enhancement
- Optimize test configuration for better performance
- Add test coverage reporting
- Enhance development workflow

## üîç Optional Enhancements

### 5. Verify Transaction Timeout Memory Leak Fix
**One-liner**: Verify that timeout handlers are properly cleared in TransactionManager
**Effort**: 30-60 minutes
**Complexity**: Trivial
**Status**: **LIKELY RESOLVED** by TransactionManager extraction

<details>
<summary>Verification Details</summary>

**Context**: Original concern about timeout handlers not being cleared may be resolved by the TransactionManager refactor.

**Verification Steps**:
- [ ] Review TransactionManager timeout implementation
- [ ] Add specific memory leak test if needed
- [ ] Confirm cleanup is working in all scenarios

**Note**: This is primarily a verification task rather than implementation.
