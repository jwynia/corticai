# Task: Fix Potential Race Condition in Connection Management

## Source
Code Review - Medium Priority Issue

## Problem Description
The current connection management in `DatabaseService` has a potential race condition where multiple concurrent calls to `open()` could result in multiple connection attempts:

```javascript
// RISKY - Multiple calls could create multiple connections
if (this.connectionPromise) {
  return await this.connectionPromise;
}
this.connectionPromise = this._createConnection();
```

In high-concurrency scenarios, this could lead to multiple database connections being created simultaneously.

## Current Code Location
- **File**: `mobile/src/services/database/DatabaseService.js`
- **Lines**: 55-62
- **Method**: `open()`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Eliminate race condition in connection creation
- [ ] Ensure only one connection attempt occurs at a time
- [ ] Maintain current API and behavior
- [ ] Handle connection failures gracefully
- [ ] Add tests for concurrent connection scenarios
- [ ] No performance degradation for normal usage
- [ ] Proper cleanup of connection promises on failure

## Root Cause
The check and assignment of `connectionPromise` is not atomic, allowing a race condition between checking for an existing promise and setting a new one.

## Proposed Solutions

### Option 1: Mutex/Lock Pattern
```javascript
async open() {
  if (this.isConnected && this.db) {
    return this.getConnectionInfo();
  }

  // Use atomic check-and-set pattern
  if (!this.connectionPromise) {
    this.connectionPromise = this._createConnection();
  }

  try {
    const result = await this.connectionPromise;
    return result;
  } finally {
    this.connectionPromise = null;
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Connection Pool Pattern
Implement a proper connection pool that handles concurrency inherently.

## Testing Requirements
- [ ] Test concurrent `open()` calls
- [ ] Test connection failure scenarios
- [ ] Test reconnection after failure
- [ ] Benchmark performance impact
- [ ] Test with React Native's JavaScript threading model

## Dependencies
- Understanding of React Native's JavaScript threading model
- May want to coordinate with connection pooling implementation
- Consider if this affects the larger architectural refactoring

## Risk Level
**Medium** - Changes core connection logic but addresses real concurrency issue

## Effort Estimate
**Medium** (30-60 minutes)
- Analyze current race condition scenarios: 10 min
- Implement synchronization fix: 25 min
- Add concurrent connection tests: 25 min

## Priority
Medium - Real issue but only affects high-concurrency scenarios

## Implementation Notes
- Consider whether React Native's single-threaded JavaScript model reduces this risk
- May want to implement connection pooling as a more complete solution
- Should test with rapid successive calls to `open()`

## Related Issues
- Could be addressed as part of the DatabaseConnection class extraction
- May want to implement proper connection pooling as a more comprehensive solution
