# Task: Refactor DatabaseService into Smaller, Focused Classes

## Source
Code Review - Medium Priority Issue

## Problem Description
The current `DatabaseService` class is 423 lines long and handles multiple responsibilities:
- Database connection management
- SQL execution
- Transaction handling
- Migration system
- Crypto key derivation
- File system operations

This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the class harder to maintain and test.

## Current Architecture
- **File**: `mobile/src/services/database/DatabaseService.js`
- **Lines**: 423 total
- **Current Responsibilities**: 6+ distinct areas

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Break DatabaseService into 4-5 focused classes
- [ ] Maintain existing public API for backward compatibility
- [ ] All existing tests pass without modification
- [ ] Each new class has < 150 lines
- [ ] Clear separation of concerns
- [ ] Improved testability of individual components
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new architecture

## Proposed Architecture
```javascript
// Core orchestrating class
class DatabaseService {
  constructor(connection, migrationManager, keyManager)
  // Delegates to focused components
}

// Individual responsibility classes
class DatabaseConnection {
  // connection management, open/close, reconnection
}

class MigrationManager {
  // migration tracking, execution, rollback
}

class CryptoKeyManager {
  // key derivation, salt generation, crypto operations
}

class QueryExecutor {
  // SQL execution, transaction handling
}
```

## Dependencies
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Requires comprehensive test coverage for each component
- May need factory pattern for dependency injection
- Should not break existing integrations

## Risk Level
**High** - Major architectural change affecting core functionality

## Effort Estimate
**Large** (2-4 hours)
- Design new architecture: 45 min
- Implement classes: 90 min
- Update tests: 60 min
- Documentation: 15 min
- Integration testing: 30 min

## Priority
Medium - Improves maintainability but not urgent

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Extract CryptoKeyManager (lowest risk)
2. **Phase 2**: Extract MigrationManager
3. **Phase 3**: Extract DatabaseConnection
4. **Phase 4**: Extract QueryExecutor
5. **Phase 5**: Update main DatabaseService to orchestrate

## Benefits
- Easier to test individual components
- Clearer code organization
- Easier to extend functionality
- Better adherence to SOLID principles
- Reduced cognitive load when working with specific areas

## Related Issues
- May want to address async anti-pattern in transaction method as part of this refactor
- Consider dependency injection pattern for better testability

## Notes
This is a significant architectural improvement that will pay dividends in long-term maintainability. Should be planned carefully with adequate testing.
