# Task: Split Large DatabaseService Class

## Source
Code Review - Medium Priority Issue

## Problem Description
The DatabaseService class has grown to 606 lines, exceeding the recommended 500 line limit. This makes the class harder to maintain, test, and understand. The class currently handles multiple responsibilities including connection management, query execution, transaction handling, and migrations.

## Current State
- **File**: `mobile/src/services/database/DatabaseService.js`
- **Lines**: 606
- **Methods**: 19+ public methods
- **Responsibilities**: Connection, queries, transactions, migrations, encryption

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DatabaseService reduced to core coordination role (<300 lines)
- [ ] Separated concerns into focused service classes
- [ ] All existing tests continue to pass
- [ ] No breaking changes to public API
- [ ] Clear separation of responsibilities
- [ ] Improved testability of individual components
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect new architecture

## Proposed Architecture
```javascript
// Core DatabaseService - coordinates other services
class DatabaseService {
  constructor() {
    this.connectionManager = new ConnectionManager();
    this.queryExecutor = new QueryExecutor(this.connectionManager);
    this.transactionManager = new TransactionManager(this.queryExecutor);
    this.migrationManager = new MigrationManager(this.queryExecutor);
  }
}

// Focused service classes
class ConnectionManager {
  // Handle connection lifecycle, reconnection, timeouts
}

class QueryExecutor {
  // Execute SQL queries with proper parameterization
}

class TransactionManager {
  // Handle transaction begin/commit/rollback logic
}

class MigrationManager {
  // Handle database migrations and versioning
}
```

## Dependencies
- Must maintain backward compatibility
- Consider impact on existing imports
- Coordinate with error handling standardization
- May affect database performance monitoring

## Risk Level
**Medium** - Structural change but with good test coverage

## Effort Estimate
**Large** (1-2 days)
- Analysis and design: 2 hours
- Implementation: 4-6 hours
- Testing and validation: 2-4 hours
- Documentation update: 1 hour

## Priority
Medium - Improves long-term maintainability but not blocking current functionality

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Create new service classes with core logic
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate methods one at a time with tests
3. **Phase 3**: Update DatabaseService to delegate to new services
4. **Phase 4**: Ensure all tests pass and no regressions
5. **Phase 5**: Update documentation and examples

## Success Metrics
- Each service class < 200 lines
- Improved test isolation (can test services independently)
- No performance degradation
- Clearer code organization

## Related Issues
- Standardized error handling (should be implemented in new services)
- Connection race condition fix (easier to fix in ConnectionManager)
- ES module migration (opportunity to modernize during refactor)

## Notes
- Consider using Repository pattern for data access
- Evaluate if Facade pattern appropriate for DatabaseService
- Opportunity to add better TypeScript types during refactor
