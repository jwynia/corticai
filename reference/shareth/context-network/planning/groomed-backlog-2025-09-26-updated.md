**Context**: LoggerService implemented and fully tested (25/25 tests passing). Now need to migrate 361 console.* calls.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All console.* calls replaced with LoggerService
- [ ] Consistent logging levels (debug, info, warn, error)
- [ ] Sensitive data filtering active
- [ ] Performance impact < 1ms per operation
- [ ] Zero console.* warnings in ESLint

**Implementation Guide**:
1. Import LoggerService in files with console calls
2. Replace console.log ‚Üí logger.info()
3. Replace console.error ‚Üí logger.error()
4. Replace console.warn ‚Üí logger.warn()
5. Add contextual information to log messages
6. Test logging in different environments

## üîç Needs Decisions

### Module System Migration Strategy
**Decision needed**: Timeline and approach for ES modules adoption
**Options**:
1. **Gradual Migration** - File by file as touched
   - Pros: Low risk, incremental progress
   - Cons: Long transition, mixed codebase styles

2. **New Files Only** - ES modules for new code
   - Pros: Simple rule, no breaking changes
   - Cons: Permanent inconsistency, two import styles

3. **Wait for React Native** - Delay until full ES module support
   - Pros: Avoid compatibility issues
   - Cons: May delay modern development patterns

**Recommendation**: New files only until React Native Metro fully supports ES modules

### P2P Networking Implementation Priority
**Decision needed**: WebRTC vs Bridgefy vs hybrid implementation order
**Options**:
1. **WebRTC First** - Internet-based P2P only
   - Pros: Simpler, well-supported, faster to market
   - Cons: No offline capability, limited use cases

2. **Bridgefy First** - Bluetooth mesh priority
   - Pros: Unique offline capability, crisis scenarios
   - Cons: Complex implementation, battery concerns

3. **Hybrid Approach** - Both with intelligent switching
   - Pros: Maximum connectivity scenarios
   - Cons: Complex, longer development time

**Recommendation**: Start with WebRTC foundation, add Bridgefy in Phase 2

### Logging Remote Collection Strategy
**Decision needed**: Should LoggerService support remote log collection?
**Options**:
1. **Local Only** - No remote collection
   - Pros: Privacy, simplicity, no backend needed
   - Cons: Limited debugging capability

2. **Opt-in Remote** - Optional with user consent
   - Pros: Debug capability, user control
   - Cons: Privacy concerns, backend complexity

3. **Crash Reports Only** - Remote only for crashes
   - Pros: Balanced approach, focused scope
   - Cons: May miss important non-crash issues

**Recommendation**: Implement adapter pattern to support future remote collection with user consent
