### Project Overview

**Shareth** is a privacy-preserving community platform that balances strong privacy guarantees with effective community organizing and abuse prevention. The name derives from the archaic third-person singular present tense of "share," positioning sharing and mutual aid as foundational values. The platform serves as a non-profit, open-source solution for communities seeking secure communication and coordination without surveillance risks or toxic behavior.

### Vision Statement

To create privacy-preserving spaces where genuine community mutual aid can flourish, protected from both surveillance and abuse, enabling collective resilience through shared resources and reciprocal support.

### Mission Statement

Shareth provides a decentralized, privacy-preserving mobile application for community organizing that employs cryptographic identity systems and community-driven moderation to protect legitimate users (protesters, mutual aid organizers, support groups) while preventing harassment and illegal activity.

### Project Objectives

1. **Privacy Protection**: Implement end-to-end encryption and minimal data collection to protect users from surveillance and data breaches
2. **Community Safety**: Develop effective abuse prevention mechanisms that work without compromising user privacy
3. **Decentralized Architecture**: Create a federated or fully distributed system that avoids central points of failure or control
4. **User Empowerment**: Enable communities to self-organize with their own governance and moderation policies
5. **Sustainable Operations**: Build as a non-profit, open-source project with community-driven development and funding

### Success Criteria

1. **Adoption by Target Communities**: Active use by mutual aid networks, activist groups, and support communities
2. **Privacy Verification**: Technical architecture prevents data collection that could be used for surveillance
3. **Self-Selection Effectiveness**: Platform naturally attracts users aligned with sharing/mutual aid values while deterring toxic actors
4. **Community Resilience**: Communities successfully organize and coordinate without central authority
5. **Sustainable Growth**: Project maintains development momentum through community contributions

### Project Scope

#### In Scope

- Mobile application for iOS and Android
- End-to-end encrypted messaging and group communication
- Decentralized identity and account recovery systems
- Community-driven moderation tools
- Resource sharing and mutual aid coordination features
- Federation or P2P protocols for decentralization
- Open-source codebase and documentation

#### Out of Scope

- Web-only interface (mobile-first approach)
- Centralized data storage or control
- Profit-driven features or business model
- Surveillance capabilities or backdoors
- Integration with commercial social networks

### Budget and Resources

- **Funding Model**: Non-profit, grant-funded and community-supported
- **Development**: Open-source contributors with potential stipends
- **Infrastructure**: Minimal due to decentralized architecture
- **Key Resources**: Developer time, security audits, community engagement

### Constraints

- **Technical**: Must work within iOS/Android restrictions on P2P networking
- **Legal**: Navigate varying international privacy and content regulations
- **Social**: Balance privacy with abuse prevention
- **Resource**: Limited funding as non-profit project
- **Adoption**: Network effects require critical mass of users

### Assumptions

- Communities desire privacy-preserving coordination tools
- Self-selection through values alignment can reduce toxic behavior
- Decentralized moderation can be effective with proper tools
- Open-source development model will attract contributors
- Grant funding and donations can sustain operations

### Risks

- **Adoption Risk**: Platform may not achieve critical mass
- **Technical Risk**: Decentralized systems are complex to build and maintain
- **Legal Risk**: Governments may attempt to mandate backdoors
- **Abuse Risk**: Bad actors may find ways to exploit the system
- **Sustainability Risk**: Funding may be insufficient for long-term operations
