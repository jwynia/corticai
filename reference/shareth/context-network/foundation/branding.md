### Name: Shareth

#### Linguistic Foundation
**Shareth** derives from the archaic third-person singular present tense of "share," following the Middle English verb conjugation pattern (-eth ending). This construction appears throughout historical texts, particularly the King James Bible and Shakespeare, giving it deep cultural resonance without being tied to any single tradition.

- **Pronunciation:** SHARE-eth (unambiguous, internationally accessible)
- **Syllables:** 2 (optimal for memorability)
- **Phonetic structure:** Strong initial consonant cluster (SH), open vowel (A), soft resolution (eth)

### Brand Positioning

#### Core Values Embodied
1. **Sharing as Foundation**: Not transactional but fundamental to community
2. **Mutual Aid**: Reciprocal support and collective resilience
3. **Generosity**: Abundance through distribution rather than hoarding
4. **Community**: Collective over individual benefit
5. **Trust**: Earned through consistent contribution

#### Self-Selection Mechanism
The name naturally filters users through values alignment:

**Attracts:**
- Community builders who understand sharing as foundation
- Mutual aid practitioners recognizing reciprocal implications
- Caregivers drawn to generous frameworks
- Collaborators seeking collective rather than individual spaces
- Resource stewards understanding commons management

**Deters:**
- Extractive users seeking one-way benefit
- Competitive personalities finding no win condition
- Trolls seeing no conflict framework
- Hoarders uncomfortable with sharing emphasis
- Individualists rejecting collective responsibility

### Competitive Differentiation

#### Versus Social Networks
Facebook/Twitter optimize for engagement metrics; Shareth optimizes for contribution and care metrics.

#### Versus Collaboration Tools
Slack/Discord center on productivity; Shareth centers on mutual support and resource sharing.

#### Versus Activist Platforms

### Implementation Considerations

#### Cultural Resonance
The name connects to:
- Biblical sharing traditions (loaves and fishes)

- Gift economy practices across cultures
- Open source sharing principles
- Modern mutual aid networks

#### International Accessibility
