# TECH-002: CRDT Implementation Selection

## Purpose
This document records the decision to use Yjs as the primary CRDT (Conflict-free Replicated Data Type) implementation for the Shareth platform's distributed state management.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Architecture
- **Stability:** Static
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Established

## Content

### Context
The Shareth platform requires robust distributed state synchronization for:
- Group state management across multiple devices
- Offline-first data synchronization
- Conflict resolution for concurrent edits
- Community governance state coordination
- Resource sharing and mutual aid data

Performance is critical since CRDT operations will be frequent with large community datasets. Memory efficiency is essential for mobile devices with limited resources.

Research conducted in September 2024 revealed significant performance differences between CRDT implementations, with some showing 30-300x performance variations.

### Decision
**Use Yjs as the primary CRDT implementation for Shareth's distributed state management.**

### Status
Accepted

### Consequences

**Positive consequences:**
- Exceptional performance: 30x faster than reference implementations, 300x faster than Automerge v1
- Memory efficient: Uses ~10% of Automerge's RAM requirements
- Mature ecosystem with react-native integration
- Y-IndexedDB provides efficient persistence layer
- Active development and maintenance
- Strong community support and documentation

**Negative consequences:**
- JavaScript-focused ecosystem may limit future platform expansion
- Vendor lock-in to Yjs-specific APIs and data structures
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Yjs patterns

**Risks introduced:**
- Dependency on single CRDT implementation
- Potential migration complexity if Yjs becomes unmaintained
- Memory usage scaling with large community datasets

**Trade-offs made:**
- Performance vs. implementation flexibility (chose performance)
- JavaScript ecosystem vs. cross-language compatibility (chose JavaScript ecosystem)
- API specificity vs. generic CRDT patterns (chose API specificity)

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Automerge 2.0
Latest version of the Automerge CRDT library

**Pros:**
- Significant improvements over v1 (86% faster, 75% less memory)
- JSON-compatible data structures
- Strong academic foundation
- Good documentation and examples
- Rust core with JavaScript bindings

**Cons:**
- Still 2x slower than Yjs in benchmarks
- 2x more memory usage than Yjs
- More complex API for React Native integration
- Smaller ecosystem compared to Yjs

#### Alternative 2: Custom CRDT Implementation
Building CRDT functionality specifically for Shareth needs

**Pros:**
- Optimized for exact use cases
- No external dependencies
- Full control over implementation details
- Potential for domain-specific optimizations

**Cons:**
- Significant development time investment
- Risk of introducing bugs in complex algorithms
- Ongoing maintenance burden
- Need to reimplement well-solved problems
- No community support or external auditing

#### Alternative 3: Y-Sweet (Yjs as a Service)
Hosted Yjs synchronization service

**Pros:**
- Reduced infrastructure complexity
- Professional hosting and maintenance
- Built-in scaling and optimization
- Simplified backend development

**Cons:**
- Dependency on external service for core functionality
- Privacy concerns with centralized data synchronization
- Conflicts with decentralized architecture goals
- Potential vendor lock-in and cost scaling

### Implementation Notes
- Integrate Yjs during Foundation Phase Task F1-DATA-002
- Use Y-IndexedDB for local persistence in React Native
- Design data models using Yjs Y.Map, Y.Array, and Y.Text types
- Plan for WebRTC-based peer-to-peer synchronization
- Implement conflict resolution patterns for community governance
- Consider memory usage monitoring for large community datasets
