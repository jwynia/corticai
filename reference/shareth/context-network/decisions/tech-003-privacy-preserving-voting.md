# TECH-003: Privacy-Preserving Voting Protocol Selection

## Purpose
This document records the decision to use Groth16 zk-SNARKs with BBS signatures for privacy-preserving voting in the Shareth platform's governance systems.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Security
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Detailed
- **Confidence:** Evolving

## Content

### Context
The Shareth platform requires privacy-preserving voting mechanisms for:
- Community governance and decision-making
- Anonymous polling and consensus building
- Democratic resource allocation decisions
- Membership and moderation decisions

Key requirements include:
- Voter anonymity and unlinkability
- Vote integrity and verifiability
- Mobile-friendly proof sizes and computation
- Resistance to coercion and vote selling
- No reliance on blockchain or external infrastructure

Research conducted in September 2024 examined various zero-knowledge proof systems and privacy-preserving voting protocols.

### Decision
**Use Groth16 zk-SNARKs for voting proofs combined with BBS signatures for voter registration and credential verification.**

### Status
Accepted

### Consequences

**Positive consequences:**
- Extremely small proof sizes (<200 bytes) ideal for mobile devices
- Fast verification times suitable for real-time governance
- Strong privacy guarantees with unlinkable votes
- BBS signatures provide flexible credential verification
- Well-established cryptographic foundations
- Active research and implementation community

**Negative consequences:**
- Requires trusted setup ceremony for Groth16 circuits
- Complex implementation requiring specialized ZK expertise
- Limited flexibility once circuits are finalized
- Higher computational requirements for proof generation

**Risks introduced:**
- Trusted setup compromise could break privacy guarantees
- Circuit bugs could enable vote manipulation
- Complexity increases attack surface
- Performance degradation on older mobile devices

**Trade-offs made:**
- Proof size vs. setup complexity (chose small proofs)
- Implementation complexity vs. privacy guarantees (chose strong privacy)
- Circuit flexibility vs. performance (chose performance)

### Alternatives Considered

#### Alternative 1: Ring Signatures
Traditional ring signature schemes for anonymous voting

**Pros:**
- Simpler implementation than zk-SNARKs
- No trusted setup required
- Well-understood cryptographic properties
- Existing library implementations available

**Cons:**
- Linear proof size growth with group size
- Limited scalability for large communities
- No support for complex voting logic
- Vulnerability to statistical analysis attacks

#### Alternative 2: zk-STARKs
Transparent zero-knowledge proofs without trusted setup

**Pros:**
- No trusted setup ceremony required
- Post-quantum security properties
- Transparent and auditable
- Support for arbitrary computation

**Cons:**
- Much larger proof sizes (10-100KB vs <200 bytes)
- Higher verification costs
- Less mature ecosystem and tooling
- Bandwidth concerns for mobile devices

#### Alternative 3: Homomorphic Encryption
Encrypted vote tallying systems

**Pros:**
- Votes remain encrypted throughout process
- Proven mathematical foundations
- Support for various voting schemes
- No trusted setup for basic schemes

**Cons:**
- Large ciphertext sizes
- Computational overhead for operations
- Key management complexity
- Limited support for complex voting logic

#### Alternative 4: Simple Commitment Schemes
Hash-based vote commitment and reveal

**Pros:**
- Simple to implement and audit
- No complex cryptography required
- Fast computation and verification
- Small bandwidth requirements

**Cons:**
- No privacy guarantees (reveals after voting)
- Vulnerable to coercion during reveal phase
- No protection against vote selling
- Limited support for complex voting scenarios

### Implementation Notes
- Implement during Community Phase Task F2-GOV-001
- Conduct trusted setup ceremony with community participation
- Design modular circuit architecture for different voting types
- Use BBS signatures for voter registration and eligibility proofs
- Implement proof verification in React Native using WebAssembly
- Plan for circuit upgrades and migration strategies
- Integrate with group management system for voter eligibility
