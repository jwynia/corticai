# Patterns Index

## Purpose
Documented patterns and best practices discovered through implementation, serving as reusable solutions for common challenges.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Process
- **Stability:** Evolving
- **Abstraction:** Pattern
- **Confidence:** Established

## Pattern Categories

### Architecture Patterns

#### Test-Driven Architecture Extraction
**File**: [tdd-architecture-extraction.md](./tdd-architecture-extraction.md)
**Context**: Extracting components from monolithic services
**Key Approach**: Write comprehensive tests before extraction
**Benefits**: Early edge case discovery, confidence in refactoring, documentation through tests
**Example**: TransactionManager extraction from DatabaseService

### Testing Patterns
*To be documented as discovered*

### Refactoring Patterns
*To be documented as discovered*

### Error Handling Patterns
*To be documented as discovered*

## Pattern Template

When documenting new patterns, use this structure:

1. **Pattern Context**: When and why to use
2. **Pattern Structure**: How to implement
3. **Benefits Observed**: What improvements result
4. **Anti-Patterns**: What to avoid
5. **When to Use**: Ideal scenarios
6. **Related Patterns**: Connected approaches
7. **References**: Real examples in codebase
